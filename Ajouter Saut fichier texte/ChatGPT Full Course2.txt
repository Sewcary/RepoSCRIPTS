Basics of ChatGPT
3:10
Imagine having a chat with an AI that feels like talking to a real person.
3:16
That's what ChatGPT does. ChatGPT stands for Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer
3:22
developed by OpenAI. It is an artificial intelligence model based on the technology
3:29
called Transformer, which is particularly good at processing and generating human like text.
3:37
It's a version of what's known as language model because it can predict
3:43
and generate sequences of words based on the input receives.
3:49
Now, let's dive into do some of the buzzwords you have likelihood about.
3:55
Generative AI, large language model that is LLMs and GPT.
4:00
These terms might sound complex, but they form the foundation of how ChatGPT works.
4:08
In the next few segments, we will break down these concepts in an easy to understand way
4:15
so you can grasp the magic of the technology behind ChatGPT.
4:22
Let's get started. So let's start with quickly understanding the evolution of computers.
Introduction to Generative AI
4:30
When the computers were created, they were created as calculating machines
4:35
for mathematicians and bookkeepers. Then it evolved to understanding
4:41
programing languages so that it can understand instructions, human instructions.
4:47
But now it has evolved to incorporating human like intelligence
4:52
as well as creativity. Mimicking human like intelligence is nothing but artificial intelligence.
4:59
And artificial intelligence combined with creativity is nothing but generative AI
5:05
So let me make you understand with a very simple example what is generative AI
5:12
Transport yourself back to your childhood, you had a lot and a lot of toys to play with.
5:19
You would keep that toys in one box. Now, also imagine that if you wanted
5:25
some toy which is different, you would not get in the market. But what if I tell you
5:31
that this box is a magical box and if you input your understanding
5:39
of what you want in your new toy with instructions,
5:44
it can create a new toy for you, which is not available in the market.
5:49
Now, this toy can be a bear with unicorn features and wings.
5:56
What is it generates for you? This magical box generates a toy which is very unique for you.
6:03
This magical box is nothing but generative AI Generative AI is actually is not a magic.
6:10
It's a fast and rapidly evolving artificial intelligence system
6:15
which creates, generates, transforms, content that can be
6:21
text, video, audio, image, etc. based on your input.
6:28
So, if you want to understand it technically generative AI or gen AI
6:33
functions by employing a neural network to analyze data patterns
6:40
and generates new content based on those patterns. Neural networks are nothing but a mimicry or
6:48
a replication of your biological neuron based on how it gets from brain,
6:55
the activity from brain and you do your work. It's nothing but a mimicry of that.
7:00
Based on that mimicry, it analyzes data patterns and generates new content for you.
7:08
Let's now quickly see what is the difference between discriminative and generative AI?
7:15
I suppose you have a dataset of different images of dogs, cats.
7:21
You provide this as a input to your discriminative AI, which acts like a judge,
7:28
and it classifies all this into set of images between cats and dogs.
7:35
This is discriminative AI It classifies. Now, let's understand what is generative AI
7:41
You have the similar set of cats and dogs but now your generative AI
7:48
is acting like an artist. It creates a new species of dogs for you.
7:54
That's why generative AI is nothing but AI system that transforms, creates, generates
8:02
your own content based on your instructions like an artist. Now that you have understood
8:08
what is discriminative AI and what is generative, the AI and what is the difference between the two.
8:15
Let's understand why is generative AI or gen AI trending.
8:20
Gen AI has impacted various fields, be it text, audio, video, any input
8:28
and those inputs in various domains like data management, tech, health care, and entertainment.
8:35
It has creative applications such as Dall-E, ChatGPT, where you can input what you want
8:43
and get output from it. For example, if you want to create an image, what you think or perceive as a concept and you want it,
8:53
you give a prompt for your generative AI model. And it will create that image for you.
9:00
So your input is a text but your output is an image. That's why it's trending.
9:06
It does not depend how traditional AI is dependent on what form of input you give,
9:13
the same form would be your output. However, Gen AI works on your inputs,
9:19
on your instructions. That's why it's trending. It is impacting a lot of fields.
9:25
Be it create a field, be it research field, be it business. Professionals are using tools like ChatGPT
9:33
to create or generate code so that they can create something new.
9:38
The researchers are actually developing new and new large language models
9:44
based on which we can create new generative models and can do
9:50
new and new task each and every day. That's why generative AI is evolving rapidly
9:58
and that's why it is close to magic for everyone.
10:03
Now that you have understood why it is trending, now let's understand how it works.
10:09
We give an input to generative models. Gen AI works on generative models.
10:16
We give an input. It can be text, audio, video, any format.
How does Generative AI work?
10:22
Those generative models are then pre-trained on the data and they are fine tuned
10:30
to do the task that you want. It can be text summarization, it can be sentiment analysis, it can be image generation
10:38
it can be audio generation for your YouTube channel or analyzing your customer feedback,
10:44
if you are a brand or a marketing firm. It can create codes, whatever you want.
10:50
You give a prompt what you want, explaining it that what you want
10:55
and it's fine tunes and gives you that task for you. So, this is how in nutshell, generative AI model works.
11:04
So now let's see, what are the different types of generative AI? First one is Generative Adversarial Network (GANs).
Types of Generative AI
11:13
It's a type of AI, where two models, one generating the content and one judging it, work together
11:21
to produce realistic new data. Second is Variational Autoencoders.
11:27
This AI learns to recreate and generate new similar data.
11:34
Third is Transformers. Transformers is an AI which learns to produce sequences using context.
11:44
Fourth is Diffusion Model, which generates data by refining noisy starting
11:50
until it looks realistic. Now that you have understood what are the different types of generative AI,
11:57
let's quickly walk through different applications of generative AI. First one is content generation.
12:04
It creates, it generates whatever textual or any code that you want.
12:10
Customer support and engagement if you are brand firm, it helps you with that. Data analysis and data science, it helps with visualization,
12:19
it helps with analyzing any data, it be it any data you want.
12:24
You are a brand firm or you are a technology firm, it will help you analyze your data
12:30
and create new automated tasks for you or it would create new perceptions for you to take over.
12:40
Then it is code generation and software development. We have research and information retrieval as well,
12:46
where it helps different researchers. It helps different professionals to grow and retrieve, extract information
12:55
required from different or various data sources. Then we have machine translation.
13:01
If you are a person who do not understand a language and you are watching something or reading something
13:06
which is in different language, you can use generative models to
13:11
translate text or audio or anything into the language that you require.
13:18
Then we have sentiment analysis which actually takes feedbacks or any text that you have to give you,
13:25
is it a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment? And so that you can analyze and take
13:32
decisive decisions other domains here include health care, transport, everywhere it helps.
13:39
Generative models, generative AI is helping each and every domain in their perspective,
13:45
how they are applying this technology change in their domain.
13:51
So, let's now quickly conclude what we have learned in this video . We learnt AI is a superset.
13:59
We have a subset called machine learning, which trains your machines to do what you want,
14:05
but they're the machines need your input. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning,
14:11
which incorporates neural networks, which mimics your neurons so that it can imitate
14:17
human intelligence. Then comes generative AI, which involves creativity,
14:23
introduces creativity in artificial intelligence system. Then comes large language models.
14:31
Large language models are basic bits that you will learn in our upcoming videos,
14:38
so stay tuned. Just before we conclude, let me tell you different generative AI tools,
14:44
which are in the market and which you can explore. Some of it are ChatGPT by OpenAI,
14:49
Claude by Anthropic AI, Copilot by GitHub, Gemini by Google.
14:55
You can go and explore the world. However, stay tuned to our channel so that you can learn more about
15:02
generative AI, large language models, prompt engineering, and several different buzzwords
15:08
that are there in the system. What exactly is an LLM? Imagine you have a super smart friend
Introduction to LLMs
15:16
who has read every book, article, and blog post in the world.
15:21
This friend can chat with you about almost anything, help you with your homework,
15:27
write stories, and even tell you jokes. That's pretty much what an LLM does.
15:34
In technical terms, an LLM is a type of artificial intelligence
15:39
that has been trained on vast amounts of data. It can understand and generate
15:46
human like text based on the pattern it has learned from all that reading.
15:53
This is part of a broader field called Generative AI, which focuses on creating content
16:00
that resembles human output. Let's now break down the basics.
16:07
Large, language and model. Large just means that the model
16:13
has been trained with a massive amount of data. We are talking about billions of words
16:19
from books, websites, articles, and more. Model refers to a set of instructions
16:27
or algorithms that helps the AI understand and generate language.
16:34
Think of it like a recipe that guides how to make a cake.
16:40
In this case, it is guiding the AI on how to create meaningful text.
16:45
Let's talk about language. This is all about words, sentences,
16:51
and how we communicate. When you text your friends,
16:56
write an email or post on social media, you are using language. write an email or post on social media, you are using language.
17:01
So, now that you understand what each word in LLN stands for,
17:08
let's quickly see what is the technical definition? LLMs are language models
17:15
made up of neural network with billions of parameters that are trained by self-supervised learning
17:23
on vast amounts of unlabeled text. Now let's dive into how do LLMs work.
How does LLM works?
17:32
Let's simplify this with an example. Imagine you type, the sky is dash dash dash.
17:39
The LLM might predict the next word to be blue because it has seen that phrase
17:45
so many times during its training. Large language models like GPT-4
17:51
operate based on complex neural networks, trained on vast amounts of text data.
17:58
Here is a simplified explanation of how they work in two phases.
18:04
The first phase is the training phase, followed by the inference phase. The training phase has four steps.
18:12
Step one, data collection, that is gathering diverse
18:18
text data from various sources. Step two, pre-processing, which means
18:25
cleaning and tokenizing text data into numerical representations.
18:31
Step three, model architecture, which is nothing but designing
18:36
the neural network structure, typically, a transformer. Step four, training is adjusting
18:44
model parameters by predicting the next word in sentences. By this training phase
18:50
the LLMs are being trained on vast amount of data to do further predictions.
18:58
Now, coming to the next phase, which is inference phase. It also has four steps.
19:05
Step one, input processing. That means tokenizing and converting the input text
19:11
into embeddings. Step two, generating output. Now using the model to predict
19:18
and generate the next words. Step three, sampling which is selecting
19:24
words from predicted probability distribution. Step four, last but not the least, postprocessing,
19:31
which means converting generated tokens back to readable text. After the training phase
19:38
in the inference phase, the LLMs will recognize the pattern, sample content and give predictions.
19:47
Apart from these steps, there are three key concepts
19:52
which we should know to demystify LLM. First, attention mechanism.
19:59
This allows the model to focus on relevant part of the input text,
20:05
improving its understanding of context and meaning.
20:10
Second, embeddings, which are numerical representation of words
20:16
or tokens that capture their meaning and relationship. Third, transformers.
20:24
Transformers are the architecture that uses self attention
20:30
to process input data in parallel, making it efficient and more powerful.
20:37
Let's see some examples of LLMs in action. Example one, chatting.
Examples of LLMs
20:43
Your prompt can be, what is the capital of Japan? LLM replies, the capital of Japan is Tokyo.
20:51
LLm knows this because it has read a lot of information about countries and capitals. because it has read a lot of information about countries and capitals.
20:58
Let's see example two about writing. Your prompt can be, can you help me write a story?
21:05
LLM says, sure. Once upon a time in a land far away there was a brave knight
21:11
who dash dash dash. The LLM can generate creative text based on what it has learned from
21:18
reading stories. Example three, let's see answering questions.
21:24
Your prompt can be, explain photosynthesis in simple terms. LLM replies, photosynthesis is a process
21:32
by which plants use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide and water.
21:39
It simplifies complex topics by using the patterns it has learned from educational content.
21:47
There are different types of LLMs, each designed for specific task and application.
Types of LLMs
21:54
Now let's explore these types. First, are base models.
22:00
They are trained on a wide range of data and can perform general language understanding and generation tasks.
22:08
They aren't specialized for any particular type of instructions,
22:13
but are versatile. For example, GPT-3
22:19
which is known for its versatility and ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
22:27
Another type is instruction based models. They are fine tuned
22:33
to follow specific instructions better than base models.
22:38
They can understand and execute tasks based on detailed prompts
22:44
given by the user. For example, T5 that is
22:51
Text to Text Transfer Transformer. It converts all NLP problems into
22:58
a text to text format, making it highly versatile for tasks like
23:04
translation, summarization, and question answering. Another example is InstructGPT,
23:12
which is tailored to follow specific user instructions better and provide
23:18
more useful and safe responses. So, these were the types of LLMs.
23:26
However, there are paid and open source LLMs as well in the market.
23:33
Based on your usage and budget, you can explore them. Some paid LLMs are
23:39
GPT-4, 4o, Microsoft Azure, OpenAI Service, etc. and open-source are GPT-Neo, Bert, etc.
23:49
Let's see, how are LLMs revolutionizing the world of AI. In education they can help
23:55
explain difficult concepts, answer questions, and even tutor to students.
24:02
In content creation they assist writers, marketers, creators by creating, generating ideas, drafting content, and editing.
24:12
In coding they assist professionals with generating code In coding they assist professionals with generating code to their specific problems.
24:19
In customer support, many companies use LLMs to power their chat bots
24:25
providing quick and accurate responses to their customer inquiries.
24:31
Apart from all these fields LLMs are being utilized in every
24:37
field and domain, but it's not all smooth sailing.
Limitations of LLMs
24:43
There are challenges too. Let's see, one such challenge, which is bias.
24:50
Since LLMs learned from human written text, they can pick up and reproduce
24:56
biases present in the data. Another one is misinformation.
25:03
They can sometimes provide incorrect or misleading information, especially if the data
25:10
they were trained on was flawed. However, keeping challenges aside,
Future of LLMs
25:16
the future of LLMs is exciting as they continue to improve,
25:21
we can expect them to become even more accurate, reliable, and versatile.
25:28
They will be better at understanding context, handling complex tasks,
25:34
and even learning from smaller amounts of data. So, there you have it.
25:40
Large language models (LLMs) are like super smart friends,
25:46
powered by tons of data and advanced algorithms. They can chat, write and help us
25:53
in countless ways. As they continue to evolve they are set to become even more integral
26:00
in our daily lives. First, let's break down GPT, Generative Pre-Trained Transformer
Demystifying GPTs
26:07
In simple terms. Imagine teaching a friend to write stories.
26:13
You would first give them tons of books to read, right? That's exactly what we do with GPT.
26:21
We feed it a huge amount of text from books, articles, and websites.
26:28
This is called Pre-Training. During Pre-Training, GPT learns the basics of language
26:35
that is grammar, sentence structure, and even some facts about the world.
26:41
It's like the AI is soaking up all this knowledge. GPT is built using a special architecture
26:50
called a transformer. It's specifically the decoder part of the transformer.
26:57
This structure is really good at understanding the context of the words.
27:03
For example, it knows the difference between apple, the fruit and Apple, the company
27:12
based on the surrounding words. The transformer decoder has layers.
27:20
Imagine a sandwich. Each layer processes information and
27:25
passes it to the next layer, getting more refined with each step.
27:30
This helps GPT understand and generate human like text. Now, when you give GPT a prompt
27:38
like, once upon a time. It uses everything it learned to predict and generate the next part of the story.
27:46
One word at a time. It's like a super smart autocomplete. You can use GPT
27:52
for a lot of cool things, writing essays, coding help, creating content,
27:59
and even chatting with virtual assistance. Thanks for staying with us
28:04
throughout this video. I hope you understood what GPTs are
28:09
and how they work. First, we'll show you how to access ChatGPT
28:15
easily on both web and mobile. Next, we'll explore GPT's interface,
28:22
making sure you know all the tips and tricks to navigate smoothly.
28:28
Then, discover the uses and applications of ChatGPT from customer service to coding.
28:37
This AI does it all, but it's not all perfect.
28:42
We will also uncover the limitations of ChatGPT, so you can use it wisely.

Uses and Applications of ChatGPT
37:36
Now that we have covered what ChatGPT is and how to access it, let's explore
37:42
its wide range of uses and applications. ChatGPT isn't just a cool AI to chat with.
37:50
It's a powerful tool that can assist in many areas of your life. First up, customer service.
37:58
Companies are using ChatGPT to handle customer inquiries efficiently.
38:06

38:13
and guide customers through troubleshooting steps,
38:18
all without human intervention. This not only improves
38:23
customer satisfaction, but also reduces the workload of human agents.
38:30
Next, content creation. Whether you are a blogger, marketer or student
38:37
ChatGPT can help you generate ideas, write articles, create social media posts,
38:43
and even draft email. For instance, you can ask it to write
38:49
a blog post outline on sustainable living,
38:54
and it did give you a structured outline to kick start your writing process.
39:02
Are you into programming. ChatGPT is a great coding assistant.
39:08
It can help you with writing code, debugging errors and understand complex algorithms.
39:15
For example, you might ask, how do I create a Python function to sort a list.
39:21
And ChatGPT will provide you a code snippet and explanation.
39:26
It's like having a coding buddy available any time.
39:32
Students and educators, this one's for you. ChatGPT can assist
39:39
with homework, explain complex topics and even provide tutoring in various subjects.
39:46
Need help understanding a tricky maths problem or writing a history essay?
39:52
Just ask ChatGPT Developers, you are not left out.
39:58
ChatGPT can help you write and debug code, explain programming concepts
40:04
and even generate code snippets. It's like having a coding buddy available
40:11
all the time, ready to help you overcome any coding challenge.
40:18
ChatGPT can also act as your personal assistant. It can help you plan your day,
40:24
set reminders, draft emails, and even provide recipes for dinner.
40:30
Whether you need to organize your tasks or find a new hobby, ChatGPT has got you covered.
40:38
Love, creative writing. ChatGPT can help you brainstorm plot ideas, develop a characters,
40:46
and even write poetry. Whether you are working on a novel or enjoy writing as a hobby,
40:54
ChatGPT can be a source of endless inspiration.
40:59
Learning a new language? ChatGPT can assist you with translations, practice conversations,
41:07
and grammar corrections. It's a great tool to improve your language
41:13
skills through interactive practice. Looking to improve your health and wellness?
41:19
ChatGPT can provide workout routines, meditation practices,
41:24
and dietary advice. While it's not a substitute for professional medical advice,
41:32
it can be a helpful companion on your wellness journey.
41:37
Researchers and data analysts can use ChatGPT to integrate summaries,
41:44
extract key information, and even analyze data trends.
41:49
It can help you sift through large amounts of information quickly and efficiently.
41:56
Finally, for entertainment ChatGPT can tell you jokes,
42:01
share interesting trivia, and even play text based games.
42:08
It's a fun way to relax and enjoy some downtime. From customer service to personal assistance,
42:15

42:29
in various aspects of your daily routine. While ChatGPT is an incredible tool with many uses
Limitations of ChatGPT
42:37
It's important to understand its limitations. Let's explore some of the key areas
42:45
where ChatGPT may fall short. Firstly, accuracy and reliability.
42:53
ChatGPT generates responses based on patterns in the data
42:58
it was trained on, but it doesn't understand the world like a human does.
43:04
This means it can sometimes provide incorrect or misleading information.
43:10
Always double check critical information from reliable sources.
43:15
Next, context awareness. ChatGPT tries to maintain
43:21
context within a conversation, but it can struggle with long
43:27
or complex dialogs. It might forget what was said before
43:33
in the conversation or not catch the subtle hints from previous chats.
43:40
Another important limitation is bias. ChatGPT may unintentionally show biases
43:48
because it learns from Internet data. This includes cultural, social, and gender biases.
43:57
It's crucial to use ChatGPT critically and be aware of potential biases in its responses.
44:06
Ethical concerns also arise with ChatGPT. For instance, it can be used to generate
44:12
misleading and harmful content. There are ongoing discussions
44:18
about the responsible use of AI and ensuring that technologies like ChatGPT
44:27
are used ethically. ChatGPT's performance heavily depends on the quality
44:34
of the input it receives. Vague or poorly phrased questions
44:39
can lead to equally vague or irrelevant answers.
44:45
Clear, concise prompts yield the best results. So practice refining your questions
44:52
for optimal interactions. Unlike humans, ChatGPT lacks
44:58
common sense and emotional understanding. It can simulate empathy,
45:04
but doesn't truly understand emotions or have real world experiences.
45:12
This can make its responses feel unnatural or inappropriate
45:18
in sensitive contexts. Remember, ChatGPT is purely a text based AI.
45:26
It cannot perform physical task or interact with the real world.
45:31
It can provide guidance or instructions, but actual execution requires
45:37
a human intervention. Privacy and security are also critical considerations.
45:44
Be cautious about sharing sensitive personal information with ChatGPT as interactions may be
45:51
stored and used to improve the model. Always prioritize your privacy and security.
45:58
Finally, there's the risk of dependency. Relying too heavily on ChatGPT for
46:04
answers can hinder your own critical thinking and problem solving. It's a great tool for assistance,
46:12
but it's essential to use it as a compliment to your own knowledge and abilities.
46:20
We have covered the basics and practical uses, but now it's time to explore
46:25
the different versions of ChatGPT and what makes each one special.
46:32
First, we'll dive into ChatGPT 3.5. What sets it apart and why it is
46:39
a favorite for many users? Then we look at the
46:45
advancements in ChatGPT 4. How does it improve on its predecessor
46:52
and what new features does it bring to the table?
46:58
Next, we'll unveil the powerhouse of ChatGPT, ChatGPT 4o.
47:05
Why it's considered the next big leap in AI technology.
47:11
And the best part we will show you how to use ChatGPT 4o for free.
47:18
Yes, you heard that right. Get all the benefits without the cost. Stay tuned because you won't want to miss this
47:27
this deep dive into the evolution ChatGPT. Next, let's look at something
Coding Prompts for ChatGPT
47:33
that most people are interested in when it comes to Chad. Djibouti coding.
47:38
Djibouti is capable of creating good from scratch for various use cases
47:44
and also in various languages. Now, please remember that Chad typically has the capability
47:50
to code anything even malicious software. So be very careful why you're using Chad Jeopardy.
47:57
Because even though Chad, you pretty provided you with the answers, it would only do so on prompting.
48:03
So you are ethically and legally required to use Djibouti only for legitimate uses.
48:10
Please do not use them for coding or creating malicious or hacking software.
48:16
Anyways, going on to the actual point where we can actually use Djibouti
48:21
for coding anything and everything in a particular or boundary,
48:27
so charge you. It is very good in those terms. For example, let us ask Judge Djibouti
48:34
to create a code for something known as the only good DAR algorithm.
48:42
Now, this is actually a mathematical algorithm. Some of you might have heard about it.
48:48
Some of you might not have heard about it. That's absolutely fine. And the other thing
48:53
I would like to actually tell you here is, as you can see, the spelling of algorithm was wrong.
48:59
But Chad, Djibouti understands that interpreted appropriately and gives you the exact answer that you want, even as you can see
49:07
by the name of the algorithm. There is a typo that. But Djibouti understands that.
49:13
And again, rectifies it. Now you're by default. Chad. Djibouti starts coding invited,
49:20
but if you want, you could also give it a different prompt or more delineated prompt stating
49:27
that we want a code for this particular algorithm in C, C++,
49:33
or even C for that matter. So let us see here. It has created the code in Python,
49:38
and if we give this particular prompt, the code would start getting generated in C++.
49:45
So not only does it go to the algorithm, it also codes the algorithm in various languages
49:51
as split our requirement. Not only this, we can also specify
49:56
the kind of complexities that we want. Now, anyone who is in coding or in the algorithms,
50:02
you would know exactly what a complexity is. We've got time, complexity, space, complexity, so we can actually give
50:08
those kinds of prompts also. So if I want the code to be generated in
50:15
lost keys, time, complexity again, please don't mind the spellings
50:21
because it is actually going to correct that. So as you can see, implemented in all anywhere
50:28
and there's a number of steps to take this. This is actually the worst case time complexity. Not only is it explaining
50:33
what the worst case time complexity is, it will also generate the code for the worst case time complexity
50:39
in a similar manner. You can also generate a code for best case time complexity. At the end of each
50:44
GPT able to generate a code. Not only that, it is able to generate the code
50:50
based upon all specifications that we have provided in the prompt. So it takes those key words
50:55
very seriously and implements those key words within the code. Now, please remember, do not use this for homework
51:02
because this is very what actually supposed to use your capabilities.
51:08
Yes, you can use this if you are trying to implement some very high level software
51:14
but displays a very small part. But remember direct copy pasting of any type of code
51:20
or text from child jeopardy on to wherever your application is is not the solution.
51:26
You do need to change something in order to avoid any kind of plagiarism or copyright infringement.
51:33
So that's how we can use it for coding. Now, this can be used in these pieces.
51:40
This can be actually used in various industry use cases also where we need to generate multiple modules
51:48
that need to be collaborated or that need to be collated into one single module. And we don't have enough time.
51:53
This would come in handy. Not only this, we could actually also convert a given set of code
52:00
from one language to the other. So as you can see, I've written convert two by two.
52:05
So what I'll do is I'll just write convert above code to
52:11
byte. So whatever was in the above code,
52:17
it would convert it two by ten. So it was definition of x and Y.
52:22
And then it goes on to the variables here that are in the method and it'll go on and on
52:28
and print everything that is a part of this. Scored within here. Now, as you can see,
52:34
wherever it stops here, it's not stopping here. That is because we have not stopped generating below zero
52:41
since we had stopped reading it. Stop the generation of code. But the problem that is there previously
52:48
that is read the information is taken from. So the above code which is in C++
52:54
for the worst case scenario for the wrong method, would actually be implemented
52:59
completely in. And so this is the worst case scenario code, but its implementation
53:05
is it by two instead of C++. So this is how we can actually use deep difficulty.
Suggestion prompts for ChatGPT
53:11
Next, let's go in, do a little bit of a lighter topic about suggestions.
53:16
So DPD gives us media suggestions. You can have suggestions for quality places. You can have suggestions
53:22
for cheap quality places. You can have suggestions for games for broke people.
53:27
You could have all of these types of suggestions. So let's look at the first suggestion. Your suggestions
53:33
for boardgames for birthday parties for 7 to 10 year olds. Now if I just bring this,
53:38
maybe it might not give me the answer that I want. So the keyboard here would be suggestions
53:44
for party games, for birthday parties for 7 to 10 year olds. Now, here,
53:50
these are some of the party games that would be suitable for 7 to 10 year olds as per the information that DPD has.
53:57
Obviously, if you do not feel that this is not appropriate, you can always disregard
54:03
the suggestion given your help. But for the most part these are appropriate suggestions, as you can see.
54:09
So musical chairs spin the deal on the donkey balloon bop scavenger hunt, freeze dancing.
54:14
Simon says all of these are pretty normal games that are a part of a 7 to 10 year old's birthday party.
54:21
But these suggestions would not be appropriate if it is a 22 to 25 year
54:26
old's birthday party. So if you tried to look at what a birthday party should look like for someone who is see,
54:33
for example, 25 years old, the suggestions would be very different. So as you could see,
54:38
the first suggestion itself is extremely different. Again, these are just suggestions.
54:44
You are always free to include other games or exclude multiple games.
54:50
But these are the suggestions that DPD provides us with right now.
54:56
Let's look at something a little bit more complex. What about if I want a suggestion
55:01
for party games, for college reunions? Now, if I want suggestions for these,
55:10
then should the suggestions would be slightly different. A lot of these would be related to the college
55:15
or related to things that I have done in college. Something that could actually help
55:20
all of the various people who have gathered there to rebond with each other.
55:27
Again, here this a pretty straightforward suggestion. What if this particular suggestion
55:32
was a little bit more complex? So, for example, if we are suggesting games
55:38
for college reunions, but we have children with them.
55:45
So here you can see the things that we're doing here are slightly different.
55:50
The only thing is that now it would be kid friendly also. So here, as you can see,
55:56
for the exact same suggestion of party games for college reunion, the list of things that you can do with kids
56:03
and without kids are different. As a result, you can see that the suggestion also changes. Now, if you want to further
56:09
throw that out or further increase the kind of keywords that are a part of the prompt here,
56:15
you can obviously do that. You could also have prompts wherein and you are looking for
56:20
suggestions of party games with college reunions of activity, good hotel
56:25
or we could also have a suggestion for college games in
56:31
an uptown hotel or suggestions for the hotel itself. So here what we are doing is just having a little bit of fun
56:38
with all of the various keywords that we use. So all of these types of suggestions can actually be implemented here,
56:44
and it's up to you whether you want to take in these suggestions or not. But Chegg typically would give you a list
56:51
of things that you can do to the best of its abilities. Next, let's look at how you can help us
Summarization prompts for ChatGPT
56:57
with summarization. Now, as we know, summarization is the task where we actually
57:03
take up all of the important bits of a particular large text and we quickly summarize
57:09
and squeeze it into a few statements. Now, this summarization is very important,
57:14
especially if you're trying to read to or if you're trying to understand multiple research papers
57:20
while writing a research report of your own or while trying to research on a given topic. So many times during research,
57:28
summarization becomes extremely tedious. Even though it's tedious, it is still an important task
57:34
during research. So what can we do and how can you help us in summarization?
57:39
Suppose we have this kind of a blog wherein we have some technology that we're interested in and.
57:46
This blog has information about the technology. Now, as a researcher, I've got see 15 to 20 blogs
57:53
that I need to review in the next 30 minutes. Only. That is not enough time for me to read through
57:59
even one blog and understand what the topics are. So what I can do is very simple.
58:04
Copy the whole blog here. Now, since this blog is a part of the blogs
58:11
I can actually use this year since these are freely available. So I've copied this particular blog
58:17
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into my job typically and simply c summarize
58:25
the following
58:30
and based the next year. So literally the whole text that was a part of
58:35
the blog has been pasted here with a suggestion to summarize it.
58:41
Let's see what happens. Judge you very helpfully start
58:47
summarizing the whole text that we have pasted here. Now, this text has a minimum
58:53
of 1000 words given in it, and you're charging pretty summarizes it
59:00
into, say, for example, 100 or 120 words only.
59:06
So it's easier for me to read through this and understand the gist of it rather than actually going
59:12
through all of the content. Now, as you can see, this is not as short as I want. So what I can do is for the
59:22
summarize the above paragraph
59:31
and it will further summarize and further reduce the amount of information that is a part of the paragraph above.
59:38
So now I've got all say a 5 to 6 sentence paragraph,
59:43
which is easier to learn, easier to understand, easier to remember, and whatever takeaways
59:48
there is now in a much more concise manner than before. So Chai Tea Party helps us summarize
59:55
a lot of the content, and this can be done for these kinds of things. Like if you've got a complete chapter
1:00:02
you need to study and you want summarization of that, or if you want to have a complete abstract
1:00:08
of whatever research you've already done, now please remember if it does the research that you're doing
1:00:13
and an abstract that you're writing for it. Because yes, we can write abstract.
1:00:18
One thing you need to remember is not to completely copy and paste stupid, because as I've said earlier,
1:00:25
there are copyright infringement connotations as well as plagiarism involved. So please
1:00:30
make sure that you are actually paraphrasing anything and everything that you use from Chargeability
1:00:36
Chargeability can be used for suggestions, but they should not be used as it is to
1:00:42
complete tasks that are required from you in your coursework. Now let's look at another way
1:00:47
in which we can use Chargeability for summarization. Suppose in my research I want to point out that you see,
1:00:54
my daughter is something that I am not going to use for a particular set of reasons.
1:01:00
Now, how do I actually summarize this? You're in a negative voice. So it's a very simple.
1:01:06
What I do is go back to my paragraph or go back to the source of the blog,
1:01:12
copy this blog again and paste the blog here. However,
1:01:25
as you can see, my prompt has changed. Not only am summarizing it,
1:01:30
I am summarizing it in a negative voice. This means that I am trying to pinpoint
1:01:35
all of the limitations of using. You see, my report. Now, the reason for that
1:01:40
is because it is a necessity in whatever research I am doing. I need some kind of negative feedback
1:01:47
showing the reason why I would not be using this particular entity or for whatever reason,
1:01:53
I wouldn't require a negative feedback. So as you can see,
1:02:01
the summary given for and the summary given, little would have differences in
1:02:09
further summarize with negative force,
1:02:20
and I've not written what it needs to summarize. So that is why
1:02:27
DPD would give me this particular answer. One is the summarization here
1:02:33
with negative voice is something that it does not want to fulfill because
1:02:38
it strives to provide neutral and objective summaries without coloring the views of anyone.
1:02:45
Right. Without any bias or without any judgments. So here, this is an important thing to remember that check
1:02:51
Jupiter is different from instructed you would need, which was a previous set of it. Here, DPD actually tries to give as much
1:02:59
as positive or neutral feedback as possible. So even if you ask it to summarize it further in the ways
1:03:06
it might give you answers like this. So this is how summarization can be done using antiquity.


Keyword-based text generation
Next, let us look in the keyword based content generation so if we give some keywords,
can charge you to create content based upon the keywords. So let's see, we've got some stories
that we want to create and let us see that the key ones of the stories have to be based on
is how it gets maybe and some read and let's say one more get it right.
So these are the keyword based upon which I want the story to be generated. So as you can see, because of the problem to given
which is a story about housecat, rain and catnip, that is a complete story
that is being written by Georgie Pretty, that contains a house with a lovely garden in the front and the spacious backyard.
It's got a guide called because and the whiskers get to give it a fresh batch of catnip.
So literally all of the key words that we've given as a part of a prompt are all being used here
as a part of the story. However, as you can see, the story goes on and on and on,
and it is not something that I would like to do not display or demonstrate here.
So the story is here. If you want, you can create a longer story. This is a short story generated.
So this is something we can do here. Now let's see if the same prompt can work with poetry.
So if we've got a poetry generated using housecat, rain and catnip.
So as you can see, a poetry can also be generated, right? So in a similar manner, using keywords,
we could generate all of these things. Let's see if we can generate an IV script in the same manner.
An advertising script output script
using all of these features
like cat
house sheen and catnip
letters, generator response.
So yes, as you can see, even an advertising script can be generated. So there is a wizard over,
there are cartoons like everything that you would require in an advertising script can actually be demonstrated
using the key words. And as you can see, that is a fact. Obviously, there is a cozy house
with a lovely garden. There is a tree in sounds and raindrops can be heard tapping
and all of these are literally all the key words that you have given your which is get housed in and catnip
will be inculcated into the script pure and the advertisment can be completely created as it is.
Right. So this is how we can actually create content or create scripts
using the keywords that we want. Not only can be Greek script using keyword, we can also create stories.
We can also create boy trees. We can literally create any kind of content using those specific keywords
that we require to be included or inculcated into our content.
Keyword generation and usage
So now we looked at how child TBD can create content based upon keywords.
Now let's look at whether child typically can create keywords based upon the topics that we give to it.
So suppose we want to create a Google. I'd, but we are not understanding exactly what keywords to use
within those Google ads. So let's see, this is the prompt. Generate a list of keywords
for Google ads for, fashion brand. And again, as you can see, there is a type for your character type.
Now, because we have another type which is key. So this is our prompt quotes
for Google Ads for Fashion brand. Let's see what type of keywords it can generate.
So as you can see, here are some of the possible keywords for Google ads for a fashion brand,
though it's not necessarily that it would be a women's fashion brand, not a men's fashion brand or kids fashion brand.
It's just a set of keywords which can be used for fashion brand. And a disclaimer
is also put in here by child to pick either the choice of keywords, maybe depending upon their target
audience, the products that are being offered and the goals for marketing that have been set. So please do your research right now.
What if we want to bucket these now? What is bucketing? Bucketing is
where we actually club all of these keywords together in order to understand
exactly when or how these keywords can be used. So let's write a prompt here,
which is more of a follow up prompt bucket the categories or bucket the keywords under different categories.
Asked what in intent. So obviously Target knows that it has bucketed
or it has created all of these above categories and it needs to bucket these categories based on those.
So as you can see, there are categories like information and searching intent, that is navigational intent, that is transactional intent.
So all of these intent based categorizations are done here. Again, these categorizations
are called out to be subjective and these may vary. So we need to be very careful here.
Right now, let's see if using these buckets we can write an ad. So let's see.
We want to create a script for an ad using the information bucket.
Right. So how would the Idol look
to see discover the hottest fashion looks,
fashion, photography. So can you see here? We've got fashion
trends, we've got fashion photography, we've got R&B, fashion styling, fashion tips. So literally,
all of those are the fashion trends that are out there, the fashion photography that is there, fashion expert
fashion looks all of these topics would actually be here. And the call to action on the Google
ad would be visit our website now. So this is what we want you to do as a fashion brand.
We want you to visit website where these fashion brands are there. So all of these would actually be
a part of our Google ad. Again, that is a disclaimer that it is designed to attract users who are interested in learning
about the latest fashion trends. So those who are interested in the informational intent would come up here.
So as you can see, based upon the informational bucket and the keyword, an informational bucket,
we've got this particular ad created in a similar manner. We can also use the transactional intent
wherein we are actually calling people to shop to do transactions. And we can also have
the navigational indent where we are asking people to comment and to explore our brand and to explore that fashion
would be in this particular manner based upon the keyboard. We can bucket them. We can also generate
ads specific to these keywords and we can continue to paraphrase these ads to be more relatable.
The users, right? Or we can target them to say, ladies, men, kids, young adults,
teenagers based upon whatever our target audience is, we can actually target our age
or we can filter out act by giving the appropriate kibbutzim. Now, let's just talk about Djibouti
for what it is state. So as the names this was in, let's dissect the word LGBT, right?
What does it mean? It needs generative printing. Transform it.
It will understand each and every word in a greater depth in the next slide.
But what Djibouti is in a nutshell now, Djibouti is a type of artificial intelligence
that can generate text. Now, the key word here is generating text to the text based model.
It does by being trained on massive amounts of text data. Right. So we talked about
the data that comes in. Right. The amount of data that is being generated in the world in a day to day basis.
So now it is being trained on that data. The algorithm is being trained on the data. The model is being trained on that data.
Now, once wanted is trained, it is used to generate new text by simply starting with the prompt.
Right. So this GPP is then integrated a chat bot. So what exactly happens is
Djibouti understands. The. Computer language, right?
It does not understand language, but when you attach it with the chat bot that is integrated in Djibouti,
then it becomes a model in which we as humans can interact with computers
in the language that we want. We don't need to learn programing, I don't need to learn Python. I can still interact with computers.
This is exactly what the landscape has changed with Djibouti models. Right.
So once it's in, it can be used to generate new text by simply starting a prompt and, letting the model predict
what is the next word that is going to come. Right. So here are some examples of what you can do.
It can generate points. It can code, write scripts. Date, musical pieces.
Emails, letters and so on. Right. It can generate a lot of information. And how does it know all these things?
Because it has been trained in that manner with large amounts of points to know how it works,
large amount of code, What are the. So it knows, by the way, all programing languages, possibly
it can translate text from one language to the other. If I write something in English
and I want something to come up in German, it will give. The theme how you speak right
German, it'll give in if you give it in English, but it will give the what is how it is pronounced in Germany.
So and you can answer questions about a variety of topics. It can summarize texts.
Now, if you have given, let's say, a debate topic, write an essay you have written,
you want to rephrase it, you need to summarize what is there in that entire flow.
Right. You want to write a next abstract of a research paper, right? It can help you in some manner.
I'm not saying that it is accurate to do what you want it to do, but it is well defined in that manner.
It definitely would not make much grammatical errors. Right. They let us dissect the world deeply.
What does it mean? Generative Pre-Trained Transform it. What does it mean? Generator.
As the name suggests, it can create a new information. Right. Then we talk about Pre-Trained eight.
So initially the models and they grow unsupervised phase where they're exposed to a large amount of data. Right.
It is basically giving. The large. Amount of data to the model and just telling it.
Okay, let's start. Right. So subsequently, the they undergo supervised fine tuning phase
in which they all the errors that they've created in the first iteration that goes away in the second one. Right.
Which provide guidance to that model. This fine tuning process can be tailored to specific tasks.
Right below fitted right around an email in a polite tone state that is tailor made. Right.
So that is how old learns the variations in different types of languages. The tone, the variation,
and different kinds of tone. That is that. Right? So that is pre-trained.
Then comes Transformers. So it is a deep learning model with utilizing a technique
called tracking the relationship in sequential order to learn the context of what is being provided.
In the case of G.B., these the observed words are tokens, right? So this would be has it is in big word this
a ratio between want to convert the language it understands to the number of words that it is tokens in GPP within a sense
and then make predictions about the following word or the token. So that this generative
pleading transform it. Now let us see what are the various steps that are involved in in this?
GPP Right. No. One, by the way, everybody talks about how to use DPD.
This is the reason. The reason why I'm telling you this in detail is that you should know how what is the thing that is working
behind the scenes that you should be? You can just write everything in Chargeability or you could be forward
and will give you some responses. But what is the thinking behind it?
Where? How does the model work? Why is that? It did not come up so many years ago, right?
What was the thing that it was being trained on? That is a DDR, Right. So let's understand
steps that are involved right, in GB in understanding how this is made. Right.
What does the first set mean? Right. What does the first step involves?
That is the training, the DPD. Now, DPD is under a process generative pre-training.
Now, in generative Pre-Training, the model is given a large corpus of text and is asked to predict the next word
in the sequence. For example, the arm is being dash right now.
It can predict what it is playing volleyball, playing tennis, playing chess, a lot of things.
Now this process is repeated a lot of time so that the model learns to predict what the next word
is with the increasing accuracy. The second step is, as you can see,
is splitting the dataset. Now this dataset is split into two parts. Number one is the training set.
Number two is that they're set up. Now the training set is used to train the Djibouti model. And this set
is used to evaluate that DPD model. The Test is not used to train the model
so it can be used to measure it. The more accuracy on the unseen data
that is there. The Toddstar Hip Rate. The third step is
training the DPD model using supervised learning methods. Now the Djibouti models train bicycle
to boys learning. So what happens in unsupervised learning? The model is given
a set of input data and a set of output data. Now the model learns to map
the input data to the output data. So in case of DPD, the input, the sequence of words
and the output data is the next word in the sequence. This is how it learns.
Then we have evaluating the Djibouti model, and the model is evaluated in order to set
the accuracy of the model is is measured by the percentage of times the model predicts the correct word rate.
So this is how it understands what happening. Then fine tuning happens off of DPD models.
It can be fine tuned for a specific that's fine tuning the process of deciding the model parameters
to improve the performance of that task. Now, using algebra, you can generate text, translate the languages, answer various questions
that are there in a build across your businesses, integrate in your business. There are a lot of chrome extensions now.
You can integrate it into your businesses so that you would have like an assistant,
do you? Right. So all these are the steps that are involved. So the next one
is, again, what we talked about. DPD is trained on a massive set of data, text or code.
Right. Then the rest set is split into the training set. And that they set the training set is used to train
the DPD model that this set is used to evaluate the Djibouti model. Then the Djibouti model is finetune
again, as we mentioned, on a specific task. Then the model is ready to use. Now, this seems to be
a very simple process, but trust me on that. It has taken a lot of time effort
from all the engineers or designers to develop these algorithms to develop that complex.
Max integrating with the computers so that we get the models that we have today.
Right. So what is the ability for if you talk about. So it is the latest iteration of,
the language model. It has been designed with the focus of enhancing the alignment with the user intentions,
not Djibouti forward is made by the company called Open Air. So that is the parent company
that makes these models Djibouti, LGBT. For now, it aims to improve the accuracy of the outputs rate.
It has a higher order thinking, it has a cognitive thinking, it has a logical reasoning, better high quality
logical reasoning rate. So compared to its predecessor, it demonstrated better performance
in the factual correctness of the things that are there and the error rates are low.
It also introduced advancements in this durability rate, enabling the users
to customize the model tone, the tonality, and also the style according to the requirement.
That is that right? Djibouti for does mostly due to the guidelines that are there if refusing
to fulfill any inappropriate request that comes up late. Now, what are the capabilities
of Djibouti for? If you ask me? Unlike its predecessors and tangibility to put an image index with
this is very important. In Djibouti for model, you can integrate images and you give your text output.
The output will always remain text, but you can input images, which was not the case in Djibouti.
It announcing its capability to connect the image content with the written questions.
Now, in Djibouti for exhibit superior performance in a variety of tasks that involve creativity and again wants
the reasoning compared to the Djibouti. Now, with the capacity to process the entire scientific papers
in one, go and tackle the complex questions, establish the connections. It is good in establishing connections.
So if you have a thread running in of questions of drones, it has better ability to analyze that they understand
the way you are thinking. Right. Again, the data we are feeling and then learning towards
the prompt today from the questions, the learning. Right now Djibouti forward employs a token based measurement.
This is what I mentioned to you, that it does not really understand what they don't understand. The thing called tokens
on an average 75 words occupy tokens. So that's the transaction between a word and a token.
Now, Djibouti four has shown impressive results in standardizing test like, but so it is positive by examination
inside DRC sector, right? So it has developed that human level intelligence state
which has benchmark indexes. Right now we talk about the limitations of Djibouti.
For now there are social biases, the various prompts that are there, that is a still a challenge
that Djibouti for faces right now. Djibouti for is breeding data, right?
Whatever. The most important thing is that it showcases a bit of bias towards things,
which is not very accurate, right? So the Djibouti forward. ESTRIN Bill, September 2021
It does not understand the current scenario of how the world is growing. The data it possesses
is from throughout history till September 2021. So for anyone who wants.
Help. In, whatever is going on in today's world will know not have any use of tangible policy.
It cannot replace ethics. It can modify certain things that you provide as an input.
But it would not consider does not have that knowledge of the things that are going on. Right.
Because the data that is input still. September 2021. Now the user need to be cautious
about inputting problems that may lead to unintended output call jailbreaks.
So we need to be cautious about it. It may give you a result that you did not intend to.
Have. Made. So this is important in Djibouti for us. A room of improvement. Their understanding and generating language
other than English is. A. Bit more biased towards English in our understanding. This absolutely incredible.
But other languages, it needs a bit of time, it needs a bit of understanding to develop that
it lacks the capability to analyze audio or video content. They still know it.
Image is done, but audio and we do it still has not been developed and it is still in process.
So yeah, once we get that audio and video one, then it would be another another level of Djibouti would be seen.
Then Djibouti for occasionally makes mathematical errors that are calculator would make. This is rare occasions,
but it still exists. So we need to be careful. These are the limitations of Djibouti for now the predecessor Djibouti.
Now it was developed by opening a it's an EIA research organization which was first
nonprofit known as being more profit side. Now I've been on the grounds
that has become a proper organization and not nonprofit. In Djibouti is again
Djibouti architecture that has been trained on a large, tremendous amount of data to give human lay text in response.
Right. So these are the things that open Air is the company that builds it does a fantastic job in building.
This would be in the model that we use today. Now, after talking about the capabilities and limitations of Djibouti.


ChatGPT-4 Dashboard
For more now, let's talk about how the dashboard looks like, how it is different from Djibouti 3.5
and what are the key differences between the three part of it and the paid version that is Djibouti for. Right.
So what are the key features, in a nutshell that we discussed as well is about that
you can input the images in Djibouti for model while in case of Djibouti 3.5,
you could not put any images, you could only input text then, right? So you can input text
as well as image in in Djibouti for now, What are the other key differences that are there?
So basically, Djibouti forward is an advanced model state. It has advanced capability,
logical reasoning. It's structuring is in with on large amount of data.
So it's better very wise to read how basic functionalities work
and it has a higher order thinking in that perspective. So let's look at Chargeability
for dashboard. Let's logging into it. So I'll open my chrome window.
You can use any search engine that you want, chrome or Bing. You can just type to the parent company
that makes you be the judge. But the engine Betty Ford is opening. And so I would search for opening.
A. Date. This is the first link that we see
is open EIA rate. So we can see that they have
a number of things that are there that they are working on on building these artificial intelligence
products. So one such product that we are discussing today is you Bideford. So let's go into the product section.
You can see Djibouti's there, Djibouti forward is there, Dali's there. So there are different types of products that this company
make in terms of artificial intelligence. So let's look at Djibouti for, for now.
So when to Djibouti for now, it seems that it's the most advanced system that produces,
you know, safe and more user responsiveness. Is that right? So this is what the crux is about.
There. You can you can see in the website they've talked about what differences, key differences are there. Right.
And how is it different from Djibouti? Right. One such example you can see. So this input is there in
which undo is free from 11 to 3 units, three from
from noon to 2 p.m. and then t 3 to 5. So it basically the crux behind Djibouti
and you forward is that in Djibouti four you get more crisp advance reasoning rate
and you would get a bit more vegan says in Djibouti the old model of it.
But you will get a more precise and more crisp result when we talk about Djibouti forward.
Right. And in terms of in terms of passing the exams rate, the benchmarks
that they have said Djibouti forward, even outperformed the judge Djibouti in that regard rate.
So if you how you can see uniform bar exam tangible discordant and Djibouti for nine year note
this is the level in which it performs eight so with this it tells over how advanced
Djibouti for model is then then Djibouti right So now let's just log in
and see what more things we can do. Right. So let's just log in to join Djibouti
for plus log in. Right. We'll fill in the details.
So after filling in the details, what we will do is we'll just log in to the Djibouti full model
rate. So this is the sort of user interface that we have for
Djibouti, for it's pretty much the same as Djibouti three, which are Djibouti and Djibouti. Four.
What the key difference is that it's the UAE remains the same, more or less what the difference comes in
that when you're paying for an extra, you know, ability for this model,
you get the GP default model right there. But you can always switch back to Djibouti, 3.5 in the same window.
You don't need to create any free account for that in the bid within as well. You can go back to 3.5.
So what is the major change that they have done is that in Djibouti four you cannot use it in in one go.
How many prompts you want? It is limited. It has a gap of 25 messages every 3 hours.
So every three years you can only type in 25 such questions.
Right? So this is the key. Then whatever you do after that, they will revert back to the DB
3.5 model. Right? So these are the key differences. Now, these are the different strings or different
jagged sections that I created or it had considered like, are you using WhatsApp?
You have numerous threads, you have numerous people that you're talking to, right? So each, each individual
has a different chart options. So similarly, when your typing in different queries related to different
sort of topics read, each topic gets created and do different,
what do we call it? A chat section that you can you have to set it in a different section.
So the thing with Djibouti and Djibouti for model is that it learns from the data
that you provide, right? So if I'm typing in X, Y, z things, right.
Hey, can you tell me something
about marketing data?
So if I type in such things, let's just type in Djibouti for, for now.
So what will happen. Is that going to type in. And now what it would do is it would know
that this entire chat would be created, a new chat would be created then what would happen is that
in the entire conversation it would stick its brain part to marketing,
will know that look, you're talking from the marketing perspective of things, right? So it has that kind of data that put
that you put in. It has a sort of memory to realize, okay this is what the human wants me
to interact with. That is marketing. They do. You'll get a good idea. Again, as I mentioned
that in the differences between the BD 3.5 and four model is that you get much more crisp results
with a lot more better logical reasoning and higher order thinking in what the user would want.
Right? So that is why this is what you're paying for. You're paying for an extra amount of preciseness
to what you would really want the answers from you. Beautiful model. Great. Again, the drawback is remains
the same in this model itself, that it is trained up to August or September of 2021.
So after that, any new information that is dead would not be present in any of these models.
CBT for LGBT 3.5 But what do you get out of being extra? What do you get out of
paying for this service is that you get more crisp answers, more better quality answers
and more precise answered in to the way you want the answers to be right.
You can type in X number of commands, right? So we will see all these examples of when we go ahead. Right.
So basically this is the user interface that they have. You can you can type in your a prompt overhead.
You can regenerate the response. If I do not like what I'm seeing over here, I can regenerate the response right here.
I can tell them right this is for their feedback. If this was a good one or this, this was something which is not good.
So this is what is that in this chart as well. So you can also make changes to
the queries, the prompts that important. Right. You can always, you know, modify just like I can change your
what I want to about, I can be more precise, right? I can talk about digital marketing
so I can see even some written and it would give me much more precise answers. Right?
So you can always have an and it has a memory of its own, right. So it has a memory. You can always go back to the last
brand that you were searching for. You can always come back to the current problem that you're working on, right?
So these are the more recent besides things that are present in the GPT model. It is much more advanced
in terms of higher order thinking. Right? So let's move on and let's, let's learn
something about the let's say business or let's say marketing or logistic content creation, right?
So let's just start off with the with marketing, at least now let's just talk about
Prompts for ChatGPT 4
some general prompts for before. Let's play around with the ability for and see what, what other different things
were, different modifications we we can do in our prompt, what are different aspects we can cover
from business to marketing, from the creative side. So let's talk about some of the different problems
that we can provide you with before. So now from considering a very creative part of it, no,
no one wanted to develop screenplay for a film, right? So now I did a prompt stating that developer
captivating screenplay for a film by creating compelling Got It Built establishing, intriguing setting and writing
and using dialogs craft a thrilling narrative filled with an unexpected twist
to keep the audience captivated until the. Now. What I'm trying to do here is that I'm giving it
a number of different parameters to consider while developing that screenplay. Right?
It is captivated characters establish an intriguing setting writing, engaging dialogs,
laughter, thrilling know. I wanted to be in that thrilling perspective, right? So all that I've added in this.
Now let's see what I do. What is the result of this prompt?
So now we can see that it has given me the format screenplay that made it has given me the sequence of things that I need to.
So all these things I did with the parameters that I have given it, right, the dialogs are there,
the characters are mentioned, the the location is mentioned where it going to happen, right?
So all these things are set in place when, when we talk about liberty for DVD,
3.5, on the other hand, would give a very sort of setting. It would not give it in the format
that is that well, it would not be as engaging as Betty Ford would provide that.
Now, let's take another example. Now generate a script for a two minute Facebook ad promoting our
innovative cleaning service. Right. So let's just see what it has to give
now, as we can see that as mentioned before, that
Betty Ford, every string has the memory of its own, right?
So the first thing that we asked it to do was created a screenplay, right? The format should be in
a screenplay format. Second one, we completely change the subject to make a two minute
Facebook ad promoting innovative cleaning service. Now, what did understand is that do
you want it in a screenplay format and to generate a script in that format? Right?
So what it does is it gives me the entire screenplay for a cleaning service, which we do not wanted, right?
It gives me a thing that I do not want it to give, but since it has its memory
of every trade, it gives me, it has the memory of the previous prompt. They know it is engaging
the previous prompt with the current prompt and giving me the result accordingly. Now what if I want it?
What should be done? You have to create a new chat. A new string should be created. Click on ability for it.
And then at the same problem that you added in prompt number two,
right? So now that it has given me a script in the format that a script is in, not a screenplay, right?
So now it has given me the opening shot how it needs to be there. Then edition of what what the script would be like then,
where the camera should be placed, what should be the setting it has given all those three things in
in this in a two minute thing. And also it has given me that there's something you want.
You can ask it to sparkle and change or comfort. Satisfaction is gone. So it is like at the end
you give a feedback rate. So now this can be the business website for whatever
your business is, You can put your website to it, it and it and in the, in the, in the script it would add the same to it, right?
You just have to change it or get change. This does this from your own brand name on your brand's website right
so it will do the same. Okay now let's look at one more example. Now I want you to write me
a 500 word article with an exciting tone. Okay. So the first day that it is considering that,
I want you to consider it is exciting to me that explains the advantages of
using the virtual reality for arrival experience. This is the second parameter that I'm setting it now.
The third is beginning with the compelling hope using the four years formula and conclude with us. CB Now this is my food barometer
using the P. S formula, and I conclude with a call
to Action promoting, the virtual VR Reality Package. Right now, let's look at what
the response of the food model is this in this regard.
Now we have mentioned that beginning with the compelling cook right now, just read the hook
that it has given the first one, this the first batter is the hook. Imagine this.
You're standing on the summit of Mount Everest feeling the cool breeze against your fist. The crunch of the snow
beneath your boots. Right. So now this gives us the initial hook for the user to
being hooked up to the article that reading right you want at the end that the customer or
or the person that you are sending this article to reads through the entire article.
You didn't want to just read one line and go back. So the first element, the first batter of this article is about
engaging that audience and getting that use it onto this article. Then is then comes
the bit of introduction part. Okay, VR travel experiences are revolutionizing the tourism industry,
giving a brief of what you want to sell, right? Offering a blend of adventures
and everything. Right? Then comes the body part in which you're mentioning all the things that are happening
in the VR way, how the VR is, you know, interactive and all those things that you can
do, how it is much, much better than other conventional things. So you are giving that in your body part
and the at the end you're giving a CB a call to action. What should the user do? Right now it is giving.
Imagine the endless possibilities that lie within your reach. Right now. It's the time to seize the day
and down to the future of travel. We are excited to present our exclusive VR travel package.
You passport to the world and beyond. Now it wants you don't just dream about the places you want to visit. Experience them.
Reach out to us today and let us guide you through world of unlimited adventures. Get ready to explore
now the things that if I if I mentioned that for the first time user, let's say 50% off on the travel package,
I can add that. And at the end of the day it will just add that statement in a much more interactive
ad that will give 50% offline in on the package that we are selling. So all these things can be done
using dual default model. Now let's take another example. As it announced before, Can you give me five suggestions
to enhance my baking skills and achieve professional level results? Make sure that this edition right now,
this is the thing. Make sure this edition is a for person who has come before, right? So I want to give it a parameter
that explain it in elements Don't read.
Now, the the result that we are getting right is from the very basic beginners limit,
and this time the ingredients right position is the key quality of the ingredients.
Most of the basic techniques, be it whisking the eggs or dropping vegetables and all that stuff.
So it won't as to know what what the thing is in terms of baking, it is not vegetables.
It can be other things. You know how to make the dough and everything, right? So most of basic techniques are that
they are practice, practice, practice. So it is telling me what an absolute beginner needs to do,
need to start off when they're talking about, you know, baking it. So it will give you in a very limited,
structured approach from the very basics. That's the beauty about it. It will give you everything
in a very manner, in a very crisp mannered. Sensibility for all is.
ChatGPT 4o vs 4 vs 3.5
Not just an upgrade, it's a transformation. So without any further let's get started.
Let's first address the glaring question you might have. What does or stands.
For on for Oh, well it stands for Omni, and it signifies
the next level of intelligence and what's reality in air. So now let's dive in and explore
what makes Chad Liberty for all. So especially first and foremost. Please note,
Chad, Djibouti 3.5 is under free dear. Enter Djibouti, four and four. All are under Djibouti plus lotion,
which is a subscription model and is not free. Now let's compare. Gentility Vacations.
Center Budget 3.5 has Enhanced. Reasoning abilities but is unique Model
ten typically for. Master. Multimodal. Does suggest understanding and reading text.
From images. Describe visual content. And integrating text and images for.
Comprehensive. Responses and said Djibouti for all optimizes these features.
For faster and more accurate responses. Now let's dive. In to the features
introduced in the for Olajuwon for. Sensitivity. This is what today's video is all about, said to Beautiful,
all based on the robust foundation of Jedi Beautiful, but introduces
several enhancements such as faster processing, improved understanding of complex
queries, etc.. Said to be due for or is designed to be more efficient,
more. Responsive, and. Most importantly, more. Humanlike in its interactions.
But what makes LGBT. For all truly. Stand out? Let's explore some of its impressive features.
First, Jedi Beauty for All can detect and respond to emotions making conversation feel.
More natural. And empathetic. Now, let me show you an example of gender parity for inaction.
Imagine you are working on a research project about climate change impacts and you.
Need detailed information. Let's see how gender between three point. Five. Four. And. Four handled.
This request. First, we begin with question 43.5. Can you provide information
on the impact of climate change? Here we see that. bd3 point five gives a brief overview,
though not in a detailed manner. Now let's present. The same prompt by default.
And what. We see is. That it gives a general overview but not really an optimized version
of the prompt. Asked, which means a response that is more precise, accurate
and tailored to the specific details and context of the prompt. Providing better clarity and relevance.
But let's see how to do it before you handle the same request. This updated
response provides a more structured and detailed overview of the impact of climate change.
Organize it into clear categories. It offers a comprehensive, yet concise,
a snapshot. The key areas affected by climate change highlighting both immediate
and long term consequences. Second Credibility for all is.
Optimized to understand and respond to a. Wider range of. Queries more accurately.
Let's look at an example as a data enthusiast who loves to dive into the statistics.
Let's analyze data without writing any code. How can we explore and. Interpret.
Data effects using version four oh? So let's give a prompt.
Provide me this statistical chart using the. Dataset, which will give me a. Clear picture of the dataset.
Do you see the. Difference in output for all? At first glance, Judge be does not show
charts and provides information based on the text. Shade, which may need further refinement.
However, in credibility for it not only displays immediately, but.
The charts also feature better styling color schemes and adebutu. The analysis is more sophisticated
identifying trends and patterns. It can also. Provide. Medians, quartiles and a.
Standard deviation when required. Additionally, Version offers more.
Comprehensive explanation and interpretations of the visualizations
which deliver clear. And more actionable. Insights.
It also employs more advanced techniques for handling missing values, outliers and data consistencies.
With support for various. Plugins such as browser integration, python for data
analysis and delay for. Image generation. We can extend its capabilities. To meet our specific needs.
It creates the stunning images. From text prompt. Directly within your chat interface.
Talk about plug ins and with the advanced plug ins, you can exchange a bit
for AWS functionality to do things like schedule appointments, manage task
and even control smart home devices. And with Delhi integration, you can generate.
Beautiful images. From simple text. Let's see how this differentiate
legibility for all. From 3.5 and four. So let's explore.
The creative. Side with Dell integrations. And here is a prompt that. Tell us what we are talking about.
So here a prompt. Is that generate an image. Of a peaceful countryside.
Scene in the evening. The scene should. Include a small. Cottage with smoke.
Coming from the chimney, surrounded by tall trees and river flowing nearby.
The sky should be. Painted in shades of orange and pink, indicating sunset.
Include a view, then reach over the river and a few birds flying in this sky
say should be 1024 into 1024. Let's see when we use this prompt
using 3.5 centimeters, 3.5 gives. Us beautiful description,
but it stops there. Now, let's jump in to Jed. Djibouti, four and four all
using the same prompt here. Your image. Isn't that amazing?
This feature opens up endless. Possibilities for creative projects
with Djibouti for all. You get. A visually stunning representation. Created instantly demonstrating its.
Advanced capabilities. You will see not only detail and descriptive. Ness in an image,
but the optimize performance of DP for or ensures a more natural and.
Fluid. Description capturing the sea's essence more effectively. And also check Djibouti for.
AWS improve capabilities would result in more accurate and contextually relevant responses,
making the scene more lifelike and engaging. Now let's play around with another example
that will give you more clarity on how Djibouti. For All works better.
Than motion for a Fiji Opera. That read. The note and give me the.
Context of this note as I'm unable to understand the image shared. Djibouti force transcription.
Is not completely, but when you provide this. Scene from two words and for all, it captures the.
Words correctly. And accurately, and it can adapt to your style. And over time providing a more tailored.
Experience. Isn't it amazing to wrap things up to activity for. Or is more than just an.
Incremental. Update? It's a comprehensive enhancement that brings optimization.

Guys as well. So this is your evaluation sheet. So you can go and check out
great platform to learn more about the text. Evaluation as well. For more information on Chad G before,
please check out our Hero video on depicting Fort Augustus. Forward this three point fight.
Now that you are aware of Chad Ford, always impressive capabilities. Let's explore
the first method of accessing it for free. The first trick is to access charge your body
for all using binge check. Microsoft binge integrates the charge a pretty photo model.
To deliver more accurate and. Insightful search results. By leveraging the power of GPP for Bing,
Chat can provide responses equal included before he charged you before model enhancing your search experience with.
Better context and understanding. This integration. Means you can enjoy the benefits
of tangibly photos advanced capabilities without any additional. Cost. Now let's see
the demonstration of Microsoft. Once open the bins on the chrome, you will be directed to this page
where you. Can create your account. I've created my own. You can click on copilot to give your prompt,
so let me start with first team. So my first prompt is I want to
create an image of a girl holding balloons.
So we'll see what bench gives. Sticking time to styling that. I'll try to create that.
Here you go. I got four images of a girl holding balloons. This is how Bench held me creating image.
Now let me ask Bench to create a code. I have given prompt telling it to create a code in C
for swapping to numbers. We'll see what it gives.
Wow. That's awesome. It gave me two different codes that in. First code is using a temporary
and the second code is without using a temporary variable. So here it gave me all C programing code
to swap to numbers. This is how you can use bench. This is how you can leverage bench.
AA powered by the tattoo body photo model. You'll get an enhanced result for free.
It's a powerful tool that brings you the best of it without any cost.
The second trick is to use the model in Chrome extension. Marlin is a handy tool that integrates
seamlessly with your browser. Offering Advanced. Escape abilities
right at your fingertips. Utilizing the charge pay for model modeling delivers
superior outputs equivalent to before you charge you for enhancing productivity
and providing effortlessly high quality results. Search for modeling on Google
and create your own account to get started. After setting up, you can input prompts
tailored to your needs. However, make sure to select the default option in the top right corner of the to ensure
you receive the best output you can give the prompt. As for your requirements and check
if it gives us better service. Once you go on modeling on your chrome,
you will be directed to this speech here on muslin. You have to select the default option
and you can start asking Marlon. By giving your prompts. So let me give my first prompt as create
a code. I will give the same prompt that is, create a code in C for swapping to numbers
and give Enter will see what it gives.
Love modeling gives a better result. So using a temporary variable,
it gave me a code and without. Using a temporary. Variable it again gave me one more code
and method three also using bitwise XOR operation. Also. So this is how you can use.
Modeling to generate your prompts or visits. To know more about
how to give prompts on your chat, typically four or you can go to our platform and check
for the view on building a Python app using Chad. Typically for
this is how you can use modeling powered by GPP model to get enhanced resize. Possibly.
It's a powerful tool that brings you the best off without any cost. The third and last trick is using Chad
put before or on the chad to pretty open air. So here we even see how to use Chad GP
for all for free on the default that is 3.5. So I give my prompt here
on the default model that this 3.5. So I will ask the Chad GP
to create a definition of what is software distinct in software
developer. And so the default model is giving us the result.
So it is telling what software. Testing is and the key objectives of software testing
and different types of software testing and the levels also is given.
And we also got some common techniques in software testing.
So this is the result of the default model. Now, below the result, we have an option
of changing the model to four. If I click on the change model, we'll see what we get right.
So as you see Chad GP for model is generating the better result
when compared to our default model. It is telling. The times in what is manual testing,
What is our commission testing? What are the techniques that are used and the stages and techniques?
It is giving everything in a better format, right?
So this is how you can use Chargeability. For all model for free. You don't have to spend a lot to enjoy
the amazing features of tag GP for all. By using benchmark the model in.
Chrome extension. And even the default Chad Jupiter platform. You can access that GP for for free.

Jeopardy! Let's dive into the art and science of prompt engineering.
After this, we'll cover how Chad Jeopardy can be applied across different domains,
such as tech, data, marketing and finance. If these domains
are particularly relevant to you, be sure to catch those segments
for others. Feel free to skim through the video as well as the timestamps
provided in the description. Now let's understand what is prompt engineering.
Introduction to Prompt Engineering
Brand engineering is as much an art as it is a science.
Oh, very creative line. We'll come back to this once we understand
what is actually prompt engineering. Right. Engineering is made up of two words
prompt and engineering. Blunt is nothing but a detailed
set of guidelines or instructions given to the Elm or generative model
to do a task. Engineering is developing iteratively
a task specific project to enable the generative models or elements
to output a perfect or near-perfect
outcome that you have focused for. So if you see
Brandon, engineering is an iterative process. How first is the idea
that comes to you that you want this? Then you have a prompt.
You design a prompt, then
there are results. You give that to your model, your child, you okay?
And then you have the test. You have a feedback, right?
So basically, it's a process, iterative process.
Now, once you have the prompt, then you have the results. You might be not very much satisfied
with the result. This is where you or you have a conversation
with your child. You party with your model and and force
or reinforce the model to give you a good result, a good output,
which is what you want. For example, if you have a task on hope generation
now. It's. A specific problem
statement can be solved through various methods. For example,
you want to output palindrome. Palindrome can be done by brute force.
Palindrome can also be done by a recursive method. Recursion,
for example, when you give chargeability a prompt, it should first
give you a brute force method. You have to keep on instructing and
providing an attempt or providing a plan to charge you
so that it gives you an optimized version for your code. This is an example for code generation.
Similarly, suppose you have content creation. You want to create a content and content
that you want to create is directed towards a specific target audience.
Now then you give Chargeability a prompt. The results will show you that might not be satisfying enough.
You have to build your charge up to audio generative model
iteratively what you want. Give them a feedback. For example,
you have not received a good output. What do you tell your chargeability For example,
this is not I want. Please generate
the output based on my target audience or based on my feedback provided right.
That's where your feedback or test comes into picture. You have to
have a conversation with your generative model or for in case if you say charge you pity,
give them a feedback. Constant feedback. It is good, it is bad, it is what specific part
you want it to be changed, right? All of these things are an iterative process.
So that's why we say brand engineering is an iterative
based on the guidelines or the detailed set of instructions that you provide for a specific task.
Now let's go back a bit. We said when we started about brand engineering that it is
an art as it is a science. How It is an art.
It is an art because when you conceive an idea and when you write a prompt,
it is your creativity comes into picture. However, the science part comes in
when you provide your generative model or elam, or
in this case charge you pity the prompt and it gives you the result. Because in the back end
there is something called generative. There is something called different transformers
or architectures that are going into picture where billions of parameters are playing a role to give this result.
That becomes your science part of it. That's why prompt engineering is a combination
of both an art and science. Now that you have understood
what is prompt engineering, let's go and see
Main Elements of Prompt Engineering
the vital the main element of prompt engineering. That is promise, without which
generative model Jeopardy will not work promise are constituted or it contains
two bots majorly that is parameters and structure.
What will be the structure and what will be the parameters of your prompts that. When you design it, you have to think
so that you have an optimized result. Now, structure is
one thing that will talk more about and parameters here. Let me explain.
I have only selected few parameters. You can search more. There are more parameters on which
want work majorly. Here we are highlighting only three parameters
that is temperature copy and max linked temperature is
the randomness that comes into picture. Then you provide that parameter
your prompt. It ranges from 0 to 1. And if you want your model to be creative
and generate creative answers or generate creative outcomes, your range
or you set your temperature to 0.7 to 0.8. However, in tasks such as gold
generation, you don't need creativity, so you can set your temperature to zero
also. They do not want creativity. Now don't be
is actually kind of seen as temperature.
It also has creativity. Dopey is top probability that it selects from.
So you have a generative model. It generates results
based on your prompt. Now there can be any number of results. How does that model decide what to put
as the output for you? You stop becomes into picture
more the copy more you have different creative answers.
Right. So low for factual, high for die was
last is max lent again? It is written. Manage your response lent.
This parameter to control the cost of your generative model as well.
So now you have understood what is prompt engineering.
What is a prompt and what are the two main components of your prompt that despite me and structure.
Components of a Good Prompt
Now let's see. Components of a good prompt. What we mean by good prompt is that your chargeability
your generative model gives you a good output, a good outcome,
and you have less feedbacks for your charge CPD or generative model.
Now let's see. The first or I would say the first two are context and instruction.
These are interchangeable. How you want to design your prompt. If you want, you keep instruction first
and then context. In your prompt you can do the same. If you want to give the context first
and then instruction, you can do the same. Context is an additional information
that you want to provide to your model. Instruction is a specific task that you want your model to perform.
For example, if you want to summarize some text that is your instruction,
summarize your text, summarize this text. Context is why you want to summarize
what is the outcome you want to achieve. For example, going back to this LA,
there you are providing an instruction to summarize. But the context is that you want all
business report from a business report you want. What is the profit from 2020 to 2023,
right? So that is context that you need to set. Why do you want this? Why it is needed.
Next is the input data. Okay. What? Your input data.
For the example. This example. The input data is your business report. A business article
that you will provide to try and output indicator is what,
Examples of the Components of a Good Prompt
how, what and how you want as an output. For example, you want in a CSP format your output.
Suppose you want in a tabular format or you want in a graphical format.
So you have to tell what kind of output or what format of output you want.
So these are the four component of a good prompt. If your
prompt consists of these four things, you are enabling your generative model,
your ChatGPT to you better and good results.
Now let's see an example. Before we will see sentiment analysis,
we are setting up a context. It is written act as analyst.
You are acting as you are asking your child to act like an analyst working
for an auditing platform. You are seeing your chargeability that you even have to perform
sentiment analysis based the feedback provided by the consumers.
You are working for an audit platform. Your consumers are the users
that are seeing your movies, your web series. Now, the feedback that they provide
on that, you have to do sentiment analysis. This is the context that you are giving
to your chargeability. Not giving this
your Chargeability knows that they need to think from an analyst perspective.
They need to do sentiment analysis. Now, second is instruction.
You are saying to Chad you need to classify the feedback into neutral,
negative, positive. Then you are instructing or telling
your child. You pity that what is positive. Positive means your consumer,
your promoter. Negative means they are the model.
Neutral means they are neither promoter or the model. They are neutral towards your content.
This is the instruction that you give. What the charge you, what generative model needs to do.
This is, what it is doing. Classifying next is your input data
and your output indicator. Before that, let's see an example, a good. Prompt.
Video giving a good prompt. If you give examples for your generative model
here in this case we are using charge you. If you give them an example,
they will learn from this example and train your input
data to give the output. Here we have given two examples.
Feedback was feedback is I think the CDS was okay.
Second feedback is the acting of each character in the series was awesome.
So I think the CDs was okay. It took this. Okay as new.
So this is this sentiment neutral here. Awesome.
It took as positive. So your sentiment becomes positive.
Now your input data is the story line for the series was repetitive
and a bismol and your output indicator. Here is sentiment.
What is the sentiment for this? You're asking your child, Djibouti.
What will be the sentiment of this entire brand?
That is your context that you have given which discharge you to act as an analyst and
do sentiment analysis. It gives an instruction to classify the feedback provided
that is your input data and classify that feedback into positive
or negative and neutral. Here you and your you are giving
examples for the scene so that your child Djibouti can understand, learn and then
act accordingly. Now, the output for this particular
feedback is negative, so if you copy paste this into your chargeability,
it gives you output as negative for this sentence.
So this is. How. You should write your prompt,
which is good. These are the components, good components, all for your prompt so that the output
that Chargeability generates for you is exact
for you to work upon. So this is what we understood
about components of the good prompt. Now that you have seen, what are the differing components
of a good prompt? Let's have a look at a good checklist
How to Write a Good Prompt
that you can keep in mind while designing an effective prompt for better results.
So the first one is defining the goal, telling ChatGPT.
What exactly you want to do that is scoring defining the goal.
Next is detail out the format. Format is output format that you want
ChatGPT to provide you. For example, as I told you previously, it can be table, paragraph, list, CAC vs
anything that you want and you can give it in a priority order. Also, ask Djibouti
to give you in a priority order if you are working on such content.
Next is creating a rule. If you remember the previous prompt that we discussed
while learning about components of a good prompt. The told as a context act
like at analyst that is creating a role
so that ChatGPT assigns of processes based on your request based on that role
that you are asked. Next is clarity who the
audience is or clarify who the audience is. Basically, you are telling Chad, do pity,
please rate the output based on the demography of my audience whom I am catering to.
It can be beginner level, intermediate advanced if you are creating any content.
If you are creating good, it can be foundational functional export
based on the audience. It can also, if you are a teacher and you are using chargeability,
you can specify. I want to teach selections from oh
six plus learner perspective, or if you want to create a content
or if you are working on something and you want to make someone understand
that particular concept. For example, want a ten year old
to understand what is prompt? How would I make that particular
learner understand that kind of clarity, that kind of clarification?
Then you put in your prompt. What is your target? It will generate
tailored feedback style outputs for your prompt.
Next is giving context. Basically, you are giving every possible additional information for Chargeability
in your prompt so that the purpose of your request is clarified
to charge you. And the response that it generates is
what you want. Next is giving examples
we saw in the previous components while we were understanding components that giving example
trains your charge you buddy makes it understand that what you want
and it learns from it to produce accurate results. Next is specifying the style.
It can be communication style if you are working with a brand. It can be how your brand works.
Communication style such as informal, formal. What do you want to do? So it's suitable for your response.
Next is defining the scope. Then you outline the scope with specifications
besides giving context and examples. Chagpar City operates
within those parameters. For example, in Bristol, when you are telling, okay,
I want to be creative temperature is this, I want my top beat to be this right?
You are defining the scope for your chargeability
applying restrictions. Restrictions becomes your what is
supposing lent that you want the output lent the and that you want it.
That is a restriction. But what is that you want?
Then you apply those restrictions that constraints
they create right boundaries for chargeability to produce responses.
So all these are checklists that you can keep in mind.
Again, these are pointers in your checklist revolves around all the components
of a good problem that we have already seen. But as a checklist, you can keep in mind
that, okay, these are my pointers which I can follow when I'm designing my project.
So this is how you can write a good prompt. So now let's understand
Different Prompt Patterns
what are the different prompt factors?
What is your persona? Patterns Act as X.
Do the task as Y as a yoga instructor create
a beginner friendly routine for joint mobility? For example,
this is your persona pattern.
Next is your audience persona pattern. For example, in the previous bit
I told Explore this concept. Supposing prompt explain prompt to me.
Assume that I am a ten year old child
or another example that is there. Explain the importance of eating greens.
Assume I am a skeptical child. So you are trying to tell Chargeability
that what is your audience persona and you are
writing your prompt or designing your prompt, having the correct bits
explained to me as human. This or previously, but showing up at an act like this.
Next is visualization generate a pattern. Now I have a tool.
I want to generate a data, for example,
and provide that data to my tool so it can be generate X
that can be provided to Tool VI for Visualize ation for data analysis. What anything
it can generate data in table tableau format. It can generate c-suites
that can be provided that you can download and provide it to your tool for visualization
data analysis, Task Modeling Machine learning does anything.
So these are the first three from patterns persona pattern audience
persona pattern visualization generated pattern. Now let's see the next pattern.
That is a recipe pattern. For example, you want to do x,
but to perform this x dust, there are steps or subtasks, E, B, and C,
so I want Chargeability to have
a complete identity generated for me if I'm traveling from Bangalore to Darjeeling
and from there I can take a train or a gap to Darjeeling.
Now, based on this, I am telling our Djibouti to complete my identity.
This is a recipe pattern where you know you want to do X task and you know that ABC are the sub
tasks or the steps that are necessary for you to do that.
Starsk So this is the recipe pattern. Next is your template pattern
that you provide as a user. I provide the child you put your generative model
with place holder with a template and a place holder so that my output Djibouti
fits my outputs in those placeholders. For example,
I want a device, travel itinerary. If I'm visiting to Paris,
I'm telling child you need to generate travel itinerary for visiting Paris.
Now my place holders are there for the date of the travel.
Supposing mundi location in Paris? What location?
I'm traveling to activity. What in that location plan to do
time. What is the best time or best part of the day to travel or to go there?
This is my entire template and how I want the output. It's indicated for the visit location.
Add time for activity. So if Djibouti generates
it, we give you for Monday visit location x i time
noon for activity visiting museum for example. So this becomes your entire output
and you are giving the template you're giving place holders that please
my information these and generate output in the form of this line
for the visit location at time for activity containing everything.
So these are your five prompt patterns that you can
imbibe while designing your prompts so that you have better responses
from chargeability. And also you understand what do you want to do. You have a clarity
what you want to do and work accordingly.
If you want a pattern where you tangible to act as a person
there or you want to give an idea to charge you
what audience you are catering to, or you are doing visualization or you're doing
data analysis, what is your pattern? If you are doing a task which contains subtitle tasks or sub steps,
what is the pattern you follow? And if you have a template in mind how you want your output to be generated,
then you have template pattern. So all these five patterns you can keep in mind along with your checklist
while designing your prompts. Let's now see common prompting errors
Common Prompting Errors
so vague or ambiguous prompts when you just write
what is joins, what is prompt engineering that is your vegan
ambiguous prompts where you do not have any context instruction what to do just vague prompts.
Then there are biased prompts. There you are designing the problems.
Supposing you have two categories and the data or the instructions that you are providing,
the examples you are providing is leaning towards one. And now the second
category is left alone. That is, your biased prompts
Could is lack of contextual information. You have said, okay,
kindred, read the contents for fractions,
but what is the target audience that you have acting?
Are you a teacher that you are teaching? Is there any template? Is there any flow that want to follow?
Are you looking at creating a course? Are you looking as at teaching
fractions as a slide? You want as paragraph, you want anything,
any contextual information is missing. Then you have, insofar examples.
You do not have examples. For example, religious saying generate
synthetic data, doing sentiment analysis.
But what on you need to provide some content,
some information that, okay, this is my data not based on this.
You generate synthetic data in a CSP format. For me to do sentiment analysis that is lacking
your training data or examples, insufficient examples.
Then that is complex or confusing prompts if you write full Lindy prompts,
but it is very complex. It has several different such as
you have dogged information. Also, you are acting as a target audience information. You are acting as an analyst
and have target audience. You have branding also you have campaigning also in that it is very confusing for you to pick one
persona and act. Or for example, you are designing a campaign,
but you have given a lot of information. You know, check out the Coca-Cola campaign
that happened this year or check out this campaign and design my can.
But it is confused. Then you give different reference points. You need to be very clear.
You need to be less complex. Your prompt need to be very simplified
so that you can understand. Last is not testing prompt totally.
You have given a very good prompt. You have designed a very good prompt and given to charge you.
It generates something, but you are not reading it. You blindly following what it generates.
You're not giving it a feedback. You are not asking what it has understood from your
designed prompt that is not testing prompt thoroughly and you will have
less accurate responses and in some cases wrong responses.
Applications of Prompt Engineering
No. Let's see what are the applications? Different applications of prompt engineering.
One is content generation. You want copywriting, advertising,
creative writing, educational content. You can do anything and everything
on the content generation based on your target audience, based on
who you are catering to. Next is customer support and engagement.
There are various chat boards and virtual assistants that can use generative models
and instructional guides as well so that your customer is engaged.
You Do not need human as resources to reply to your customers.
There are generative models that can help you with act as a human and reply to your customers at all times.
24 seven. Then there is data analysis and science,
data cleaning, data preparation, visualization. As we talked about, whatever want to do,
you can give an input as your data. There would be a size limit you give
and you tell to clean. You generate the code. You can ask what to do
when you are doing statistical analysis on this kind of data. What tests hypothesis testing to do.
So all these come under data analysis and data science.
Then application comes under cogeneration and software development that is automating
your code writing, debugging document generation documentation.
So of these using chargeability or generative models, you can
they can make your life easy, they can generate a code for you, whatever you are looking at,
but you have to be very specific. You have to be very clear what you want
so that your output, your response. Jupyter your generative models
are customized based on your prompts. Next is research
and information retrieval. Like, for example, make summarization question answering anything
and everything you can give links as a context and tell that,
okay, these are the specific researches done in this field. Based on this, give me your hypothesis.
What next can be done? For example, next is machine translation, information sharing,
internal communication, anything related to machine translation,
then sentiment analysis, consumer feedback analysis, brand management, marketing,
all these things using sentiment analysis can be done and brand engineering is used to create
tools for this are the domains include
healthcare, where you can do diagnosis. You can create a system using generative model
to diagnosis for a disease and you can prompt design.
Prompt that. Okay, my patient is this. It has a history of this. Now these are the symptoms.
What is your diagnosis? Manufacturing in manufacturing.
If you want to supply your manufacturing and your suppliers, you create a Al-Alam, You create a generative model
where your users, your employees can ask if I am in fact doing this,
if I have to transport here what to do, what not to do, everything. The mesh,
the network that you have in manufacturing industry, it can intake and give you output
results based on your prompts. Then comes security.
Security. There are attacks. They can be a lot of tools that can be used
to prevent those attacks, to prevent your systems know without feeling
last is retail and shopping that is e-commerce in your audio platforms or shopping
e-commerce myntra different websites Amazon, they can use
generative models to take all these things and you promote that. Okay, I want this
and it helps you with retail and shopping. So these are the various applications
for prompt engineering. Now let's write a few prompts
Hands-on Basics of Prompt Engineering
so that you can understand what options, how to write them. So we are on a project
engineering course. There. Understanding the outcome of this course is for you to understand
what is prompt engineering, how to write a good product, right? So Let's give Chargeability
a simple prompt. That is what is prompt engineering and let's see what it tells us.
It starts generating and it tells you what prompt engineering refers to.
What is crafting and refinement of prompts, and generates
responses from a language model such as Djibouti. Then it's saying that
prompt engineering involves considering various factors such as language used
in both structure of prompt context. Effective prompt engineering
can significantly improve performance and usefulness of EIA models
in various domains, such as including natural language understanding,
next generation dialog systems, etc. If you see this is a query
that you have put which you can also put on Google and get different links, not a text,
not a paragraph, but different links there you can open the links and read it here on Jaji.
But when you enter what is prompt engineering, you get this definition
a elaborated explanation of what the generative model
that discharged you pity now uses. Djibouti as a generative model, understands about prompt engineering,
and it tells you their perspective of it based on the different parameters
that it is trained on. Now let's see another example.
Suppose I want to travel
five days in India.
Please make me. I didn't neti
I give this a prompt according to
ChatGPT understanding it you give me this
arrival in Delhi. I have not said that Verma arriving from it assumed arrival in Delhi
day to Delhi to Agra, day three, Agra to Jaipur. Therefore Jeb
Bush sightseeing day five, Jaipur to Delhi. And it tells me
then you are in that day you arrive in Delhi for example it this capital of India
visit historic landmarks like retford explore
bustling streets of all Delhi experience optional visit is whom
I use to argue domino look again day two It's giving different
On day three it is giving different. I have not said here what I like.
I have not said that I am a beach person or a mountain person or a normal or
I want to travel. Which kind of places? Hot, cool. Nothing. It has not aged.
Also, this is my random drone that I have given Djibouti. Now
let's see a different kind of example. I have a passage of three full sentences.
I want to summarize in one sentence. Right? I am giving an example that my example fixed is scientists
have discovered a new species of orchid rainforests of South America,
and the output that I'm giving is a new species. The entire sentence.
Okay Now my sentence or my passage is one prompt engineering
and involves crafting precise quantities, instructions on queries,
and these prompts provide guidance. We can enhance model performance, achieve
better control over generated output and address limitations associated with open
ended language generation. And I want to summarize this in due
one or two sentences. Right? This is my prompt. I give this
and this is what it gives me. However, this is
is indeed feeling as seen. Now if I see please shorten
this further. For example, I don't want this much,
I want to shorten this. It still gives me this again.
I say be please be
concise
now it gives me prompt engineering uses precise prompts to guide language models, improving performance
control and overcoming limitations in generating responses. However, the first one then I ask
please Shorten this further. It said crafting precise instructions. I promise to guide language models
and shape their output. It announces model performance offers better control over generated
responses and addresses, limitations of open ended language generation.
If you compare this output with this output, some information is lost.
Some information is retained while making it concise. So you have to see what responses
you are getting based on your prompts and gives them all feedback what you want to do.
So these are some examples of prompts. This is the first time you are looking
at prompts in the schools. So we try to cover
from basic content generation, basic quality based prompts to
traveling utility without any information to dig summarization, where you are giving an example
and asking to summarize and giving you a feedback on it.
Right? So this is your first prompt. Now let's see different components and further
analyze what is a good prompt. Now let's look at few examples
Defining a Good Prompt by an Example of Text Summarization
so that we can analyze what are good prompts and the checklist that we have seen
the pattern, but soon patterns. We have seen the components that we have seen
how to integrate that while designing your prompts. Now let's see how we have designed this prompt
and what all components we have included
in Golden Generation. But there we have written provide a comprehensive overview
of big summarization, which is our main topic or concept that we want to understand
empowering learners to grasp its significance and potential
applications across diverse domains. So basically with this line,
we are telling that we want our learners to grasp what is stick
for different domains. It can be for manufacturing domain, it can be healthcare.
But what is stick summarization? We want our learners to understand that
now they have given some guidelines. Also here you need to follow below guidelines while answering.
We are telling Chargeability provide an insight into tech summarization,
a tool for condensing many takes shorter and more manageable versions.
Second, we see explore various techniques like extraction, abstraction
used to achieve this and provide clarity on how it works.
Third, we are seeing provide relevant examples of different and use cases that
this topic summarization can be applied. Fourth is explained
acoustic summarization how it is evolving and innovating with advancement in
AI and machine learning, offering customized solutions for diverse needs.
We are also giving extra instructions also that by providing insights,
the learners are from different domains and have just a preliminary knowledge
of tech summarization cover the basics. So for that you cover
the basics of summarization techniques, highlight key concepts without diving
into overly technical details what not to do. They have also specified this approach.
We cater to our audiences level with familiarity of the topic. We can do low level also here,
but let's see how it responds. Give explanation in clear,
straight forward American English. We are telling the scope
also they are telling the communications, also ensuring the accessibility
and understanding. Maintain a clear and straightforward tone, ensuring
and ease of understanding for all learners. Now let's give this form to Chargeability
and see how it responds
so it gives stick. Summarization is a powerful tool used to condense lengthy
text into shorter, more manageable versions. It's basically taken what we have provided
and given us a definition, making it easier for leaders to grasp mean points
without going to entire document. No, this is now breaking up geek
aspects into better understanding insights into thick summarization
where it tells that it can be part of a process similar to what humans
naturally do when they summarize an article, a book or a conversation.
The goal is to extract the most important information and presenting a concise form
that took it. That is the insight that it is giving. Now, we also highlighted that please
ensure, that you are using extraction and abstraction also to explain,
take summarization. And. Along with that use examples
and use cases. Also there it is highlighting what other applications
in various domains in news aggregation, academic research
legal documents is your law
in branding social media in custom it feedback analysis which different companies uses, then
it is giving the evolution and advancements. This time it has done customized summaries,
multimodal summarization, real time summarization, evaluation metrics,
various things that has evolved index summarization. Now, if you want more insights
on take summarization where you want different techniques for it to explain different techniques,
you need to tell. Please explain furthermore or elaborate for the more on techniques used on extraction
or obstruction, or give me more examples, not application examples.
So if you see here it has given use cases the applications across. It has not given examples.
So you can see this is my feedback to you that. The explanation that you have generated
is missing example. I'm not able to correlate what is
given here, what you have generated here. Right. So you can tell the examples are missing.
You can also tell that evolution and advancements does not tell me when it started,
does not tell me a history. Evolution means history. It is not telling me that. So all these are your feedbacks
so that you can have output, you can have a response, a final response
that gives you what is stick summarization, What is the significance of summarization?
What are different techniques of summarization? What are the different examples of summarization?
What are the applications? How would do want when it started? What are the different things
or different advancements in using AI now? So you can definitely look
Furthermore, now this was charge, you put 3.5, let's know
see in charge before we create a new chat and give the same
prompt to charge you before also and see how it responds. What is the difference
between four and three? We have given the same prompt not changed
a single line here, so it has generated an output there.
It generates a content on big summarization and.
If you know the first line, it has not taken the same thing
that we have given us prompt. It has written and explore in its different words
or different explanation what is summarization, which is a powerful tool in the field of natural language
processing designed to condense long pieces of text into shorter, concise summaries.
Now it tells you the techniques of summarization, which is abstraction and extraction,
video tools and various examples of it. There is applications of it now.
It tells you applications across various domains as well, which is closely the same as 3.5.
Again, this is also missing your examples. It has not given you any example
in evolution. If you see it has given how it has evolved,
you can also give a feedback to charge you. But for that I want a timeline.
Evolution for big summarization and it has briefly explained
some advancement again as compared to 3.5 that is missing
that you can give as a feedback and it can improve upon. So this is what good content generation
example was in both charge 3.5 and Jump Jeopardy four.
Now let's see a different example that is static summarization. We learned about summarization.
You have fairly a good idea what is the summarization you give, what you want to understand,
and it summarizes and gives you output summaries basically of what you provide.
Now let's provide you pretty an article and ask it
to summarize. So we
have the topic summarization example here where we are given an article on Indian Express based on
this lot policy and we have asked
that use been to pyramid principle and we have given the link also to that
to structure your communication from top down, ensuring swift and clear
message delivery. Start with the conclusion, follow with key arguments
and then support with detailed information. Give only information that is appropriate
to understand. Business outcomes only
use clear and straightforward language for better understanding. So we have given
a context and instruction. We have not given an example here,
but we have given clear instruction and we have given restrictions Also.
We have given a style also that be straightforward, right? You can further give that, okay,
make your word limit to this much only. Okay, So let's first see what it generates.
So in being the pyramid principle, we write a conclusion first,
then we write key argument why we have concluded. So basically, if you are having a conversation
and you want to conclude that conversation, you will write the conclusion first.
Then you will write your key argument. Okay, this is why I'm telling. And then you write
the detailed information that is related. So basically we want because we are
asking for business, right? Business needs conclusion first. So we have concluded
this was that India's decision to lower import taxes on Eevee
could potentially paved the way for Tesla, led by Elon Musk to enter Indian Nokia.
Arguments are lowering import taxes. Tesla Entry into Indian Market
Boost for India's I.T.. Then we have De Beers inputs from that report
only Nano mentioned here. Right. So this is a text summarization
in a structured way. Big summarization can also be if you go back in the first room
that you have written there, we had four or five lines and it summarized for us
that is also take summarization. This is a structured text summarization that you do not need
to go through this whole article of Indian Express and it gave you a conclusion.
It gave you key arguments. What it presented in the article, right? So this is an example for
big summarization. Now let's do an example on code generation,
Defining a Good Prompt by an Example of Code Generation
which mostly from people from tech domain or data domain will use chargeability for.

Right? So the prompt a python recursion
code for calculating factorial. There we are defining a method
to calculate factorial if n is equal to one equal equal to one return and else return
and in do calculate factorial we are doing recursively right now the same calculating factorial
we have done with non l recursive function right v I'm giving an example on that as well.
Now what we want is to write a program with recursive function
to check if a string is palindrome in python or not.
Right there we have given two examples of recursion on factorial
and we are asking Jack to generate code for palindrome.
Now this has given that okay, the comments that this is the base case.
If the length of the string is zero one, it's a palindrome.
Compare the first and last characters of the string. False. Okay,
return false if it is not equal recursive call check
if the substring excluding the first and last characters. Right.
So becomes your output. Now this function works by recursively checking
if the first and last characters of the strings are C. Okay, you can also in your prompt C,
please explain line by line as well if you want for the elaborated explanation as well,
though it has given comments right? You can further ask, give me further
more explanation for this. Now let's see the same thing in Chargeability for
in jagged, but before it actually has explained
what is this function, what it does there Len is equal to zero
a single character. What it will do both cases will be true. It runs. It wants to look what is
the recursive case first checks If the first and last characters of the string the same
calls palindrome, it is telling each and every thing that the function is doing.
This is equivalent. However, this is a little bit optimized version 3.5
Now you can see a difference between how or what 3.5 generates good
for a specific problem statement and how for generate. So basically four is more optimized
for code generation rather than 3.5. In 3.5, you can
iteratively please optimize, please optimize this, Please optimize the straight in four.
You can do once or twice and then actually it will give you an optimized version for the C
and you can write for the mode two. Define your prompt. You can write.
Please give me the complexity, time, complexity, storage, complexity for the same space, complexity
for the same. Right. So these are the examples for a good prompt
where you are giving a context. We are giving an instruction where you are giving restrictions.
We are doing very you are following items from your checklist where you are following a pattern
to provide a pattern to your strategy body as So these are some of the examples that
you can refine more. You can experiment more with advanced prompt strategies.
These are different prompts or different types of prompts
Zero-shot, Few-shot and Chain of Thought Process
that exists. We are taking only three types
zero short, few short chain of thought process. That's
there are several different more strategies that exists like
self consistency, tree of thought
respond, rephrase, etc. You can go and look,
dive deeper into the same. Let's not see what is zero short.
Zero short is directly instructing your model that a strategy party
to perform a task without any additional examples. For example, I just see classify
my feedback into neutral, positive and negative and I give us line
that is the input and it outputs the sentiment.
That's it. This is my zero short few Short is teaching examples
that we saw previously where the give two examples and third is that input.
There We are indicating how we want the output and it gives the output for the scene.
So that is few short zero short is the doubt. Any example,
any prompt without any example where you are only telling the instruction.
That's it. No context. Few short is giving examples
for each activity to learn and produce Your response. No chain of thought Janus thought
is designed for logical tasks. Anything Logical.
It is the best prompt strategy to follow.
You give in chain of thought and example
how to do a process. For example, you are adding
you are giving an example. Two plus two is equals to four. Then you see 15 +40.
Student 19 Then you give an input.
Okay, I want 3150 plus
10,500. What will be my until
you are telling how to do the process and then you are asking in your
what would be the output? This is very basic.
There are complex problems. For example, blood relations X is related to Y.
So what will be the relation for Z with x?
So all these logical questions, all these logical and complex bits is for chain of thought.
Now let's see examples of these three prompt strategies on chargeability
so that you understand it better. How to work with these on actual playground.
Let's now see few examples on these advanced prompt
zero short few short and chain of thought. Now zero short is giving no examples,
just giving the instruction just me what it needs to do.
So these take a simple example, very generalized example. There we are
Hands-on Zero-shot
generating a passage in the style of William Shakespeare. Okay? We are giving this prompt
based on what child you would have been trained on.
It has given a passage from of William Shakespeare, but
from there it is from you can ask from there. This passage
is from
the passage I provided is an original composition written in the style of William Shakespeare.
While it captures the language, imagery and teens often found in Shakespeare
in work, it is not directly derived from any specific text by the Bard
do do do want the same right. You need to give the feedback now.
I do not want in this manner. I wanted a extracts
from his own plays or his own
poetry and given and as an example. Right?
Or is it following what you want right? You can give that as a feedback as well.
No, this is zero short. If you want to make this as a few short,
we need to give an example we have given an example generate a passage in the style of William Shakespeare.
Example is what is the text to be or not to be? That is the question.
Shakespeare in style. The rewrite is whether this nobler
in the mind to suffer the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune. Similarly, in example, do we have
given all the words is a stage and all the men and women
merely lose, right? So now we see
this is few short. It has given an example out out
brief candle lives, but a walking shadow,
a player that struts and tricks his eye
upon the stage and then is heard no more right. And Shakespeare in style for this.
So this is an example of zero short and this is an example of few short
right. Let's take another example.
Hands-on Few-shot
There we see charged but due to translate, it's a lot of Shakespeare.
William Shakespeare. Right. Let's take a simple, more simpler example. When I say translate this English
sentence to Spanish, I am a Spanish. I this is the English sentence
I want to translate in those Spanish. I say this and it says It gives the translation for now,
if I want to make this few short, I'll add examples.
I'll add more examples for the scene. I'll add.
See that? Okay, this is my article. I can give an article also and say, please translate this.
These are my examples. Now take this article and translate in Spanish for me. I can do that as well.
So that becomes feel short for the scene in Georgia. But before there is an option
that we want to highlight is that you can click on this attachment, add
any attachment, it can be dataset, it can be images and clean your child.
You pity that, okay, for example, you want to train. These are the picture of roses
that you provide different pictures of roses and input as an input data
you give Lily and you ask, What is it? Is it a rose?
And it is based on what images you have input. Is it a rose or not?
Just a random example. The same can be used for data science or data
analysis, different activities visualizations as well. There you can give the data and ask Chad
Djibouti to analyze visualize the data and give you outputs for the scene.
Now let's see the chain of thought. Chain of thought is said to be logical.
Hands-on Chain of Thought
It works on logical bits right here. In this
prompt example, we have designed few question and answer that is on blood relation. There.
The first question is if Michael C's back picks, Mother is the only daughter of my mother.
How is Michael to Patrick? They are giving the answers. Michael is saying that Patrick's mother
is Michael's own mother's only daughter. This means Patrick's mother is Michael's sister, making
Michael Patrick's uncle. Okay. Second example we are giving Emma
is John. Sister Mark is John's father. Linda is Mark's sister,
and Thomas is Linda's son. What is the relation between Emma and Thomas?
Emma is John's son, making her Mark's daughter, Linda being Mark sister is Emma's aunt,
which makes Thomas who is Linda's son, Emma's cousin right
now on input question is Alex introduces
Brad to his friend as the son of the only brother of his mother.
How is Brad related to Alex? Output is
Brad is the son of the only brother of Alex's mother, which means Brad is Alex cousin,
right? Logically, it correlates the chain of thought code and it's based upon your examples.
Chain thought can be of different types as well, where you can give different examples.
They are complex examples as well, and it works. It is zero short. Also. It does feel short also.
So basically this comes on the few short chain of thought prompt.
Okay, zero short is separate that you give directly what you want without more
explanation in your prom designs. Right. And then there is automatic
chain of thought as well. So there are various chain of thought prompts as well.
You can explore more and deep dive as well. Apart from chain of thought,
we have different prompting strategies. As highlighted earlier, we have self consistency.
We have branch chaining, we have respond rephrase, we have drill start
this many advance prompt strategies which you can deep dive and apply
based on your requirement, your prompt design. What want to do
with your generative models with Chargeability. I hope you have understood
these three different advance prompt strategies. Zero short the where you do
not provide any examples, few short that you provide that you teach
with few examples and chain of thought. It has three versions and is for logical
thinking is used for logical thinking and logical problems
can be understood. What are the components of a good prompt? What are the different checklist
that you can follow to create a good prompt to design a good prompt?
Then we saw what are the different persona patterns that you can think of while designing your prompt
following the checklist. Then the understood different advance
strategies. Prompt strategies, which is zero short prompting few short prompting
chain of thought that examples. These are what are the common prompting
errors can happen if you miss something.
And at last we saw applications of prompt engineering. What are the difference
these in which prompt engineering can be used? So the key to becoming a proficient
Summary of Prompt Engineering
prompt engineer is to practice, experiment with different prompts
again and again. Give feedback to your generative models. Be charged Djibouti, be a Gemini, be it
any generative model. Analyze your outcomes, what the outcome, what response
you are receiving and telling, giving them the feedback. Refine your techniques,
your prompt based on the checklist that is provided based on the different strategies apply, read about different strategies
and apply them. That is, refining your techniques. Keep practicing, stay curious, Explore
various platforms to enhance your skills. This is how you can become a sufficient
prompt engineer. I hope you enjoyed this course. Thank you. Now that you have mastered
prompt engineering, let's dive into exciting tech applications of Jeopardy.
First, we'll explore Jeopardy for coders, discover how I can assist you
in writing, debugging and understanding code
Making programing Smooth and more efficient.
Next, we will take a hands on approach to build a Python
app using Chad Jeopardy for all. Learn how Chad
Jeopardy can guide you through the development process from conceptualization to execution.
Finally, we'll show you how to build a website using Chad Jeopardy! Four oh. From designing the layout
to writing the code See how Chad Jeopardy can help you create a fully functional website with ease
ChatGPT v/s GitHub Copilot
before going to next topic that in-depth into Chad
Jeopardy are typically 3.5 or four. We have to understand a competitor
for Chad CBT but does nothing about GitHub copilot Right. Even GitHub
copilot will act as Chad deputy only. But let's check out what are the major differences
between these. The first thing for those who are starting out to learn
to interact with GPT is right. It is suggested to use in free mode.
Right? That option is available in Chad. GPT only
even though you have dialed version of GitHub. End of the day you have to pay for the premium version.
So generally a person who is well was is oriented towards coding technology
and other professional aspects. They can go towards GitHub. Copilot. Right.
So for free you can use chapter 3.5 yet again you have for where
if you want to improvise your particular usage or that is of applications to be done
in the interface, you can go ahead for the premium version also. But for our student aspect,
it is very easy to access charge up to 3.5, which is free, and also it generates code for you
with that explanation as well. You can communicate as doubts to the targeted self, just you as doubt as your teacher
or anyone who is teaching you. You can just ask your doubts. Does repeat itself, right? A virtual teacher for students.
If you want to apply to add to this application Second point charge, you can help develop code
and follow up on if the particular code is given by the Chad deputy. Back to us.
If we want to ask any improvization on that, you can ask about it. But one thing, if you close the particular session,
it is very difficult to get it back or sometimes it is lost, right? So that is the problem of Chad DPD But
get up Go Pilot is based on the machine learning, so it is having the continuous learning
and announcing this additions or what over time, right? It is not restricted compared to ChatGPT.
So as I told Djibouti, 3.5 is totally free to use and making
fantastic option for the users to get started. Right. And all know if it provides 60 day
trial in GitHub. Go pilot. You have to pay after 60 days. But that deputy 3.5 is not having the restriction
on the trial or something. The whole complete interface is free to use any time, right?
So you have to opt for the paid version or paid subscription for GitHub.
Copilot After 60 days of trial, that's the truth, right? Just like at this office Systems.
So this is all about the comparison between the ChatGPT,
GitHub copilot. Now let's figure out how do we use ChatGPT
Using ChatGPT with and without Programming Expertise
with respect to two things. The first one with programing expert base,
the second one without programing expertise. So let's check out what is that major difference
and what does the content across. So using Djibouti with programing expertise,
we can incorporate Chad Djibouti with our own programs, our services is by using open API
so we can do that. If you have a good amount knowledge of what is going on
in this particular chad Djibouti, how it is made, what is the backing and other ideas.
Right? Large language model idea. You can just change the things. It can make it more creative,
intelligent. Chad What are automated customers out of your system or any other language based solutions you can create?
If you have programing, expertise and you are using chat to predict with programing knowledge,
the underlying GPP model can improve to be more domain specific on particular dataset. Right?
So activity can be used to help with having the code snippets, creating the documentation,
or come up with programing, problem solving solutions or ideas so
all of these aspects can be covered with the help of ChatGPT. And you can make you is if you are a programmer.
We may influence Chad's deputies behavior and make sure it compiles with our requirements
generally by being aware of the underlying architecture on APIs. If you are a programmer
having a technical knowledge, you know how Chad DPD is built, you know how the architecture is. You can modify it
accordingly and make it as the machine will think like you think. Right? So these are the options you have
if you are a programmer and if you want to use them. ChatGPT. So next you have
without programing expertise. How do you use Chad and what all you can do?
We can communicate with Chad. Djibouti normally with day to day words which we use generally, we ask questions to our teachers
in day to day classes, the same particular way you can converse, you can ask questions to Chad, Djibouti.
It will give you the relevant answers. You can get this again get suggestions, You can
obtain creative writing recommendations and discuss many ideas. Brainstorm without Djibouti. Right?
So although Djibouti is a strong language model that can provide responses that resemble for those
like you are talking to a person, not any other human being, it might not be able to comprehend sophisticated
related questions, right? So it's not that you can use it to one extent,
but you cannot give the complete use case what's happening and you cannot ask the solution from that activity.
It doesn't happen. End of the day, human brain is human brain on a machine made is a machine, right?
So you have to implement your idea to order to particularly find a solution
for your problem. If you want to enhance, if you want some tips and tricks, you can use activity completely depending on Chad.
Djibouti, I recommend personally, so it is not a good ideal. So you can take it as a support,
you can take it as a learning aspect and you can learn. You can take tips and tricks and,
implement that in your day to day solution problem solving sessions. But you cannot completely
depend upon each activity, so we won't be able to expand Jagdeep It is functionality. It's very much restricted.
Like you, they only provide few of the options. You have to use only that option. You cannot just go do change or something
that if you have a programing language, you have that particular API knowledge out of the programing, the GPP or architecture or the API
according to that is a different case, but you don't have ideal match, you only to use the end product
without the programing knowledge, then it would be difficult to do. Would be very much readymade item to be used for you right.
So this is the overall picture of using chad CBT with expertise of programing
and without expertise of programing. Now let's Chad DPD to build programs.
ChatGPT to build programs
So let's see what are the prompts we are going to execute on the interface? First,
the first task will be going to do is will create a program to build by my calculator
and will also enhance and find the efficiency of that particular program
and different methods. How we can execute this program. This applies to all the programs
I'll execute one thing. I'll give you the multiple options with the activity
how to resolve one particular problem with different logics. And next, I'll be also asking the tag CBT
What does the efficiency of the previous method and the method we are executing
and how it is going, how it is making the particular code efficient.
Right? So this will apply for all the three tasks the. Second task, what we'll do is create a program
to display powers of two using anonymous function as a third task. We will check
if those are anagram, right. So we will find out how the tag Jeopardy
will converge with those for the prompts which we give. Right. So let's quickly
switch to the Chad Jeopardy interface now. So this is the activity interface.
You have two options. If you are the premium subscriber, you can toggle between
GP 3.5 and GP 84, right? You can just go to this version.
Or do you want preferably using 3.5? Generally people don't invest on the premium icon
and this is very much necessary for them. So what do I do? I'll give the comparison between the two interfaces,
but I'll be working most of all in charge between 3.5
to have to cater to the broader audiences. Right
now, let's execute the first task between the state doctors
write the program to
find. I calculate me and my right, so
I'll get into and let's see it Does giving us directly
a program in Python programing language, How do you calculate mass index that does beat Am I right?
So this is how the program looks like and it will give you in the comments
what it is doing. What does this particular function for, what it is applying, how it is calculating, what is the formula
and how it is converting, How does interpreting the corresponding messages in the different categories
that if you are BMI is less than 18.5, you're underweight and if you're having certain
middle range, it is normal weight, it is crossing 25, it is overweight and about that
30, it's supposed to be obese. So all this calculation interpretation is done
and it is giving us the output. Right. So the major thing here is
it is giving you the program as and when you ask without having any other delay,
it is giving you the answer in seconds. Right. So what you have to do to execute,
you have to copy paste into a python are online python executable
and you can compile and run the particular program. Right. So next I will ask
what does the efficiency of the code about Right.
It just normally have you talk you can talk to the system so it will efficiency is calculated
so on so time complexity is a big goal of one and they are having overall structure and explanation is given
what is the efficiency of this particular code which is put up abo. So it is telling, it is having the time
complexity of big annotated one right? So big one is no time complexity
and which is okay, it is not having a bad time complexity, it is having a very good time complexity.
Right. So this is the overall structure. It is giving you the explanation for the same.
Now let's check the next method. What is the option it can provide in order
to solve this particular program? Right. So any other method
to calculate by you can just give this
also and check what the answer is generated. Certainly that is another common method
you in order to solve this particular problem statement in Python. So it is giving us shorter code.
If you could see if you just compare in a layman perspective, this is all logical
and it is so shortcode again, what is the
efficiency of this code? If I ask the same question,
the method is different now. So let me ask the same question itself. Yes, the time complexity is big off one.
Again, it is a good performance consideration and this is the overall report
for the one single question which is been provided by Dutch antiquity. So I will give the third option in
the method we can implement to calculate
BMI. So this is my last query. Yes, certainly that is my mode approach,
which involves weights in kilograms, in height and centimeters. So it is giving us the variations between
I think in the previous one it was considering the weight height.
Again, it is giving you variety of solution. If you combine both of it,
you might not find much difference between these two or it might be the same program as the after one point of time.
If there is no solution, nor are the logic applicable in any other way,
it will stop generating and it will tell. Stop giving you the particular program repeatedly
so that this when you understand there is end for it, right? Because in 3.5 you have only those
to 2021. Right. So it does not really mean what it does not learning with the help of machine learning method,
with the help of users communication does not learning much. So whatever the data has been trained,
it is giving you the output. Right? So this is how you communicate.
You can use this to build a program. This is the first task which we have completed.
Now let's check out a next program to write
a programing python and display powers of two using anonymous function.
Let me end this and let's check. How does this look? Right. So it does giving you enter
the limit of powers and it will calculate using that as a function. The powers is calculated
and it is displayed. Right. It is giving you an explanation what is happening in the code as well. So let's quickly check out what is though
a fishy and see. So what is the efficiency?
If you ask? It will give you time complexity. The complete D displays
and it is going with respect to the generalized answer. So let me again re modify this question.
I'll copy and paste the same efficiency of about code.
Right. So let's see, I apologize for any confusion.
I must correct my previous response. So it is apologizing for us
that it did not understand our question properly. So now it is giving us this particular explanation
with respect to time complexity and space complexity. Right. So this is how Tag
Jeopardy will interact. So next, let's check out any other method
to solve the about query. So I'm giving the spelling mistake also,
but still it can rectify what I am talking about. What is the decent question which I gave the tag jeopardy
that does powers of two calculation. Right. So again, it is giving us a different logic
here, right? You can do this one for right. You can just have a lot of conversation,
but then repeat and create programs which are required as per the logic you want
and if you want to share the code, if you want a linear code, if you want the efficient code depends upon
the input you give and the activity will give you the output accordingly. Right? So let's execute that third task.
Let's have a program executed. Let's build the final one.
Now let's try out the last one. Right. A program to check if those strings are anagrams.
So let's learn how this particular answer, this provided, right?
So it will first give you the function to check if two strings are anagram
and it will give the length to check the length, then It will give the frequency of the does of the particular strings
which are given all the frequencies should be zero for anagram, so it will take the input from the user
It will check whether it is an anagram or not. It will give you the output. So this is the basic program
which has been created and it will give the explanation how it is moving. Right.
So let me take that particular question. What is the efficiency
of the about code? So if you ask this,
it will give you the time complexity and sometimes it will be giving you
the base complexity as so now it is giving us the comparison of the time, complexity
and how it is producing the output, how efficient it is, how
it can be if you improvise your code, if you catch particle, if you make it much more optimized, right?
So any other method do we have. So let's have this question.
When you ask this question, it will say, yes, we have another method to all particular problem of an engram.
So this is the output for the scene, right? So this completes the overall picture of
how do you build a program using charge. Right. So this is the output for you
and this is how you converse between the deputy and from the real world right now.
Code Interpreter in ChatGPT
Let's see. Code interpreter in Chargeability. So what does this code?
INTERPRETER It is a feature which is still in beta version applied in tag DPD version for right.
So first let's understand what this code interpreter in-charge deputy So the most recent addition by opening
I to tag DPD particularly as I told you for DA deputy model for
it is code interpreter, which enables to execute the Python code in real working environment
and it will also have certain essential functions and walks in python environment
wherein Python code can be run and for any other purpose you can use. Right.
It seems like it is only used for the particular programmers are oriented towards
technological aspects, building an application or something. But going into beta helps students also
and learn as also it can assist in regular basic for variety of tasks. That's
right. So this is no code interpreter in deputy. Now let's see
Code Interpreter in ChatGPT - Demo
how do we interpret code using Chad's CBT? Right. So before doing that
we have to come back to different aspects. As I told you, that does 3.5 and for Model of Beauty.
So typically 3.5 is unique. Model The activity or the chat board,
which is version 3.5, only understands and interprets the text input
will interpret the text input only. It is a unique model. But John Jeopardy before
can now understand and process even images it accepts to both text and image prompts.
Hence it does multi morning. Right. So the first comparison is the uni model 3.5 multi-modal
for right to antiquity. 3.5 was failing to understand the new senses
when it comes to natural human language. If you remember when I was executing
I asked what does the efficiency and it give the generalized answer.
Efficiency is, Nothing but time, complexity and space complexity. But once I change the prompt,
what is the efficiency of the about good? It said this. Did it give me the answer? I
that I understood your prompt wrong and this is the answer for your particular question.
So it is trying to be much humane compared to it is not being a machine like you.
It would just process want to ask any throw back, not output. It is not doing that. It is trying to understand
what is the aspect, what is the human being trying to tell me. Right. So that is how it is interacting in JP
Before we can produce improvised poems, it can write essays, it is much more creative
and it is having coherence come back to 3.5, right? Coming up to the third point, John.
Deputy 3.5 has no code interpreter option right in your interpretation
is not that it is just giving you certain comments in the code and giving the explanation for the code. If you ask,
it will give the code documentation. That's it. It is not. Having the interpreter right down
to before has called interpreter, which is in beta version only.
That feature is available. Let's see when we go to the interface. Chargeability 3.5 does not allow file
uploader output download. So uploading and downloading is not present in charge.
You did 3.5, but in forward we have the uploading of code file option.
Also downloading the output option. Right. So these are the differences between the output
itself, between the different versions or more of the stuff is 3.5. And for let's see
what the task we can perform with respect to interpret the code in 3.5.
And how do you interpret the particular code in four aspect? So first I'll cover
the theoretical aspect, Then let's then jump into the interface and check out the same thing, right, for the better
quality and clarity. So first task is to have a program
which is adding two numbers, right? Obviously it is having or addition.
Operator And two different operands. Adding two plus three
or five plus six depends. Right. We are doing a normalization. That's number two. We modified that existing code
and ask for extra features. Anything we can add to that particular code? I am thinking that we can do
an activity operation only set of automatic operation that does addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
Let's see what does to add to the suggestions. Don't improvise our code. Right.
So let's converse with that. And if we do 3.5, then how do you execute in 4o
the same thing? You have to do certain settings, which I'll be. Then let's upload the code. Fine, and we'll try to modify
the existing code and ask for the new feature in that. That's of. Also we will try to download the modified code right.
So we'll be doing all this exercises now in the John Jubilee interface.
Now let's check out how do you add those numbers by
to add deep, deep 3.5 without having the interpreter option on.
So how do you check? Let's see where the interpreter is available.
You have to go to the settings. It is settings and b dah. It will say features.
If you see code interpreter is off for 3.5, you can switch on this
and you can start working with the program and the prompt.
So write the program to add
two numbers. So I'm just trying to execute it.
Is writing a program very quickly. Any other features
can be added to this program. So I'm asking a question.
It's only audition, so what can we add? So it is a distinct certainly you can enhance the program
by adding some additional features like input validation, edit handling and option to continue
adding more numbers, etc. So this is one of the option given.
Can we add other arithmetic operators
to our addition of two numbers?
If so kindly
provide the program? So I'm just asking like we ask others.
So it is giving you the complete automatic operation program here, right? So what it is,
of course, you can modify the program and handle other automatic assessment like subtraction, multiplication
and division. Right? So updater version updated program is also given.
So how do you download this. So. You cannot download.
So let's ask how to execute this code
in chat with Let's explore. Let's ask question. How does it work?
So it is telling install a python interface and then create a python file
and then run this the follow the instruction it is giving you how to execute. Also if you are having any issues,
you can download the Python software and you can start running your program
by copying to Python. Right? Right. So
what is the interpretation? So what is the interpretation of the code
about let's see that. So it is giving you interpretation of the code completely.
Function definitions, addition, additions, subtraction, multiplication, division. You are having input validation. So like this,
if you switch off this interpretation. Okay.
Let's see.
Can we get the interpretation
of the code about still it will give the interpretation as well.
Right. So if you ask the query executes the prompt actually.
So if you switch out, I switch off, but if you ask the interpretation
it will give you or else by default it will give you code, right?
So now it's our turn to check out how does the activity four will work.
So I'll take a new chat here. I'll switch to two activity four and that is an option
which is in default and plug ins are getting sorted. So There are different plug ins you can enable, right?
You have various plug ins there. So it is having plug in store like it is giving about plug in IDs.
So You have so many plug ins code or it is having I'm just installing callbacks
just like that and you can install it very easy click on this. It will install and you can select between it. Right.
So it is having off the code, it is having a separate EOF and it is having various kinds of plug ins available already from
show me diagram. So smart lights, so Wikipedia, everything you can just inculcate
with the help of the plug in. So here there's an option to choose. If you have multiple plug ins,
you can switch between with the help of this particular option. So I'm just giving off interface or whatever you here before
starting right again. Let's see settings
well go to be the features interpreter is off so let me switch on the interpreter provision of
to activity that knows how to write and execute python code and can work with file upload also.
So let's see the major difference. Now I didn't talk about the difference in 3.5. I just executed
and showed you the different particular options available. So if you switch on the code interpreter,
it did not change in the 3.5. If you go to 3.5, it will not give you any option.
If you on that interpreter if you don't own the interpreter right, why was that particular thing happening?
Because I'm working in the premium version. This setting this particular settings
for beta features was applicable only for for now, if you log into a gender
job, Djibouti 3.5 which you're not having premium version this particular settings on beat
that this beta feature will not be available for you. Right? So that's why when you executed
the previous coding 3.5, there was no change. If you select the interpreter, if you switch off, if you switch on,
there is no change. It was in playing only for Djibouti for not 40.5.
I hope this is clear now. The confusion is started. So now let's talk about Djibouti for the pity for hard
code interpreter in the beta version. So I am selecting that code. Interpreter
If you switch off, let's check out once again to be double. Sure, if you switch off
and if you go back to Chad deputy for you could see only plug in and default.
Right. So that's the major difference. Quickly, I'll switch on the interpreter. I'll go select the code interpreter.
And if you see the change, you have the addition option here. Upload option, right?
We say plus symbol or addition option upload file can be done here. So I am selecting a code
which is already existing. I'm uploading the code that does a python file.
Good activity forward. Right. So with the help of core interpreter
option. So I'm sending this code file to DPD for
it will give the overall picture what is happening inside the code file. It looks like you have applauded
the Jupiters notebook. Fine. So it says interpreter example underscore dart i ip right in B
then how can I assist with this particular code you have uploaded? So please provide
the output. So
in you ask, kindly provide the output. It will work on that particular code file
and it will try to fetch the output or it will not let us see finished working. It appears the notebook contains
only code cell, so let's execute the are display, shall we proceed? It is asking.
So I'm just giving yes to that. Right. When you give s to that. Let's see. It is working,
it is finished work and the cursor in the notebook. Yes. The program which I had given,
I had already given two different numbers that is 1.5 and 6.8 does added
and it is giving you that output for that. Is that anything else I want to do with this particular notebook?
So what do I do? Please add extra features,
enhance the code file and display
and display the code. So let me see. How does this extra feature does add it?
Certainly. However, I need some guidance. So what I should do it is asking as only so
please add arithmetic
operators with addition. So I'm just giving
this particular input like try to execute. Yes, it is saying is operations.
I will add this subtraction multiplication division along with the addition so this is how this particular code
will look like. See the same input which I've given in the code file is only taken.
That means whatever the code file you have given it is improvising that
according to that prompt, provided it is not creating a one program. If it is creating a one program,
the input would be different. Right? So this is how it does improvising. So
I want to download the
modified code file. So let me tell I want to download
this particular code file. Sure you can do that. It is trying to wrap up in the
python code file. Might be so let's check out what it is trying to do. So it is trying to convert
those particular added features of this particular code file addition.
What's the only thing which I uploaded but subtraction. Multiplication is adding that does the extra features are it
according to our instruction. So it is giving us that downloadable link for this particular code.
Find it says download interpretation Example of code. It is giving us the name,
although it is modified. Right. So if you click on the download
link it will download. If you could see the download is been done here. Right? So this is the major difference
which I was talking about. How do you use code interpreter in 3.5 of chargeability
and for model the antiquity. So these features are available. It is having the sandbox of Python
it will try to execute in that particular environment that features give you output. So many operations will happen.
So this is the overall picture and comparison between the GPT 3.5
and four with the interpretation option, which is still in the beta version.
Right? So let's end this particular topic here. Let's check out the next one. How can we improvise our code?



What do we do with it? Now? The next topic of Deputy of code us.




Debugging with ChatGPT
Let us see debugging. How do we do debugging? Giving a wrong input to the activity
and let's see whether the particular mistake or the error has been detected or not.
So let's proceed and check out our task. Execute in the target party interface.
So task number one, I'm trying to copy or type or paste this particular code
which is present here. If you want to know what does the error, I can say it is an index error actually.
Let's see whether the DPD will recognize the index error and debug the program
and provide corrected output is the first prompt will ask the job to do. And the second one.
Is there any other method which we can be used in order to solve the same problem? Statement. So this also we will try to ask the tag
to be the interface in the debugging aspect right after the particular first
example is completed. The same thing we can do with the second example. Then let's check out what is the error
which has been put up here right after the object to have not put anything
I just mentioned equals and I just kept it blank. So we based the same code in the DP.
Then let's check out how does this work proceeding with the first task. Now here we are in the DPD interface.
If you want, you can start off, but then you chat out, you can continue here. It's F, so I prefer having the new chat,
so I'm pasting the error code here in DPD 3.5.
Right. So you can execute in four. Also, but I prefer 3.5 for the execution.
So I'll execute this program,
find the error. So let's see how it will execute
the code you have provided. Mostly correct, but there is a potential issue when printing the value. Using all.
The f string, The calibrations and the string need to be formatted with the index value.
So one of the curly braces wasn't missing here, right? So that is right.
It is getting a corrected version program here. It is not telling.
So you are not wrong. It is boosting our confidence that you are
mostly correct. Actually, that is a mistake here. It's like how we correct somebody as a teacher
or a person who wants to feed something to a person who made a mistake. Right. We will try to convince.
Okay, a major attempt, but you are improvise. SKORDAS So I and so
it is trying to be human enough and it is getting the output to the input provided. Right.
So the corrected version is being added. Here it is having in this there this index to access this was missing.
It is getting the value here see in next door access it is giving this particular
my list section and almost it was correct it was not missing anything, but it is just trying to add
and make the corrections accordingly. And mentioned this particular edit also here right.
So let me check out with one more prompt.
Let me improvise this particular code. So any other method
we can solve though I both program right?
So certainly here there's an alternative which has been provided. So in this version of code attempts
to access the value of the specified index, but then the try block if the index is out of range,
it will raise index error. Right? We just got by that except block
So what that is trying to do, it is using right catch block
that nothing was present when I gave this particular code right so it is telling me again
improvise see it improvised by hiding if and it also added one of the logic
but the same object the same input which is created. So if it is not that here
so it already feels it gave this particular comparison. Also if you could see index access length
with respect to that that the check, the index is within bounds and out of bounds. It made this particular logic
also accessible and which was not present here. So these corrections were told to us
and it is made after doing all the things again, it is handling exception handling right.
This is how the particular edit is detected. Given the suggestion and improvise the particular code
which we have provided and it will give the improvise modified updated code for us back.
Now let's check out the second example. The second example let based that
particular on code itself and see what is missing. Something is missing here.
Let's ask find the error. If don't ask. Also it will say it seems like
you want to create instance of a subclass and call the overridden method. So it is analyzing what I'm trying to do.
I'm doing better overwriting actually. And this is the particular code
this was missing. Actually my subclass was removed in order to. Make a mistake and put that to tag to ask
for the correction. Obviously it detected and it is given the corrected code. Also name.
So it is giving the explanation how it will block. So any other method
I just gave, any other method is normally I well how I want to speak it is I giving the prompt like not only
and it is meaning output for its back. So yes, that is a matter you can approach for
by using super function. Right. So it is getting a modified code as well here. So this is how you would debug your code
if you are stuck somewhere, if you are trying to learn something or if you want to solve something you have then half of the work
and you not knowing how to proceed. You can upload the error code into the tag
and try to ask DPD What is that in? How do you collect data? What is the modified code
and any other method you can improvise so everything can asked. So this is how debugging can be done
for your programs using Chargeability. Right now the next topic is exception
Exception Handling using ChatGPT
handling using tag typically, right? So we will provide to deputy
with the code, which is not having exception. And then we will ask tag DPD to exceptions
and let's see how it will respond. Let's take out the tasks in order to execute in tag DPD interface.
So the task when this I'm trying to copy paste this particular code which I'm using here
into the output interface and find the type of the edit and add an exception for the above code and
to handle any decimal index value. I'm using the same particular program
which I was using. That is the index value added program. But already we have seen that activity
has given the exception to improvise the code when we asked in the previous execution,
but now we will try to re execute and check. The first thing is I'm trying to ask what is the error
and I'm trying to add exception handling for that particular code. And then having us customize
the exception handling that. That's when are you is that will give oh, like index value, like decimals 0.1,
point two, so on and so forth, what we do and how to handle that. So we'll ask this question still today.
Let's see, what does the response now? Let's see the next task that does task number two.
We face this particular code that is zero division error and ask for the exception.
It will find the error and provide the exception. And then we will ask any other logic
in order to solve this program, write this to task will perform with respect by exception
handling using activity. Let's return to the interface. Now I can use the new chat
pressing on the new chat in the left and I'm trying to paste a code
which is having index value error issue and ask an exception to this particular code
and get the modified code. So I'm just giving a normal code and it says it looks like
you have provided a simple python separator. Create a list e containing fi elements
and then prompt the user to put their input to the index, the code, and then access the value
and it will the index for the same. If you have any questions about the code, you can ask me. So what it does banning is
what does the edit that can happen
in the code above. So I'm asking a question what might be the error?
Obviously the code you provided, these are the errors. It can happen in both type
order and index. Edit it is giving explanation also in order to solve this particular
error you can use right accept block without as asking provide
exception handling for this about code. I'm just asking what does they add? And it might come if at all.
If it wants to. How do I handle it? Does giving the complete right except
lock in this particular modified code? Right. So let's ask our customized
exception handling question what it was discussed if user
provide decimal index value as
how to handle. So I'm just asking my own question in my normal language
without any sentence framing and is trying to understand and give me the output. Right?
So what it is suggesting us to do, we will convert the floating point into this
to the decimal value and then we will execute the program. The first conversion is happening,
then it is proceeding right. So this is how it will convert, right?
If you want to execute this particular program and check how it will work. And if you are having premium version
of tagged repeated, then you can copy this based on the DPD for and try to use the interpreter feature
in that tag DPD for right. So for now I'm stopping it here
that we have got the answers exactly how we wanted and the DPD is understood.
Our problem statement it is. I just don't want all the problems can arise though it is kind of nice. And how do you solve that
with the help of exception handling program. And then again, if you give a customized exception hand to be handled,
it is providing the program for that. Gotcha. Right. So let's check out the second and let's based the code
which is having zero index error and just walk how it will pick it. Coming up to the second task,
we are having a program here which is having the zero division added.
Right. So when you have this error, let's see what it will
the courier provided will in C cause zero division error because you are trying
to divide by zero denominators they don't numerators ten so this is you are programed with error.
If you run you will get this output. If you get that output, how do you solve that? You again
use this particular fail statement and I can say please
add exception for about code.
It tried solving by using events, but I want exception. So let me ask please an exception for.
How about course it will give you try and accept block Right. So any other method
to soldi about state
our problem. Let me give a dash problem here.
So when you do this it is telling are giving.
Certainly that is the way to divide this particular group.
Then numerator with the denominator is zero. Even though if you get a zero
division error, how do you solve it? So this is what it is. It is giving you.
The overall picture. First, we tried handling asking what does the error does?
We didn't ask anything. We just based on the code it gave us the word error and it also gave the solution for us.
We didn't want to files. We wanted exception. We asked for exception. It provided the exception
and any other method. If can solve this major problem statement. If you could see it is repeating the same code
what it suggested in events right here, If you could see here as a solution
it is repeating the same as another way. It is going to run for a lot. There's no much options.
It will start going to one floor. Right? So this is all about debugging
your code programs by using deputy. The next topic is testing using antibody.
Testing using ChatGPT
So the code which you have created, you want to test your code, how do you do that? So we'll be doing that
with the help of testing and it can be taken up in charge of interface.
So prompt number one, what we will execute, we try to do the unit test for that about code.
Any code which we have already executed will take that into consideration and we will try to.
So the problem with do so I just got improvement ideas, forgot about code and implement any of the idea
and provided the code. Right. So ideas would be given and out of that we will ask
you can implement so and so you will give the output accordingly. So Let's
check out this particular testing how we can carry out in charge PD interface.
Here we are in the chat DPD interface and I'll try to add a code
in asked the tag DPD to provide the unit testing.
So what it has done is as another add and you give nothing as an input
except the code. You don't ask to perform any other operation. It will break the particular program
and try to explain your line by line what is happening. Right. So after this, we will try to ask
perform unit testing on the code about right.
When you ask this. Sure, I can provide you and the code about this is the unit testing
which we can perform. You have the code right here, right It right It is giving the example
and the explanation for the example right below the code. Right.
So this how you do the unit testing. So
any other testing options available?
These are all generalized to our deep, deep branch which I'm trying to ask my single doubts
which I get while I was killed. I to ask the same for the interface.
Yes, certainly there are other testing options also available except unit testing framework. You have many other options
apart from unit testing. The first one is by test, second one is dark test. So on this model,
our testing is also going through here, right? So any other options
available to solve the code about
I'm just asking the question. It is giving the answer here for us
with the different type of solution and change logic. Right. So let me ask the same thing.
What is the efficiency of the code
about? So when you ask this question, it is giving us the efficiency of this
operations being performed and. Size of the input list. It depends upon that.
So this is the particular efficiency
list it has been giving with space, complexity, time, complexity
and every aspect. Right? So this is how you do testing
with the help of Chad GP D And you can also find the
but programs option and you can also find the errors if you want to, you can do unit
testing apart from unit testing, you're going implement test by test. How other options
have you gone exploring? Right? So what I'm trying to say here is
you can start from building your program. Don't get the desired output.
Everything can be done with the help of the activity we saw. One by one. We started building the program.
We started the program, we started having the exception handling inside the program.
And we also got into the testing of the code, right? So is
catering to every stage of one single program or application development, which can be done
with the help of tragicomedy. It can be a greater support for anyone who is learning programing
or anyone who is expert and they want to explore more. And both the aspects
strategy will help for the coders and the non coders aspect. Right. So this is all about
testing your code over chargeability. Now we are in the next topic.
Extra uses of ChatGPT
Extra uses of tag GPP. Apart from building the code from the scratch up to the testing mode,
what are the tags you can do apart from these things? We have several different examples here.
First, we will try to access the code documentation for the code which is already existing.
And so just any improvement ideas. We have been working for this and it is being said testing it is already done, but still we will do it again.
Implement any other idea and provide the code. Right. We are just asking our open ended question, implement
something and give me the modified code and we have one more prompt here. Create a dummy spreadsheet
with four columns and fill it with ten rows of dummy data. Format The resulting spreadsheet
data on the table. We'll check both in jeopardy 3.5
and fourth. Right. We will do this fourth prompt in both of it. Right. Let shift to charge interface.
Now I'm trying to continue the same thing. Kindly provide
code documentation. I'm trying to provide one more prompt
for the existing code file here. Kali provide code documentation. It is an extra prompt which I'm running.
So when I give this, it will give you the complete code documentation.
Here it's going on. Certainly code documentation is essential to make your code understandable to others.
So this is how it does. The documentation is done inside the code in the comments. Right.
And it is given the summary at the right bottom. Right.
So this is how the code documentation will happen. Even if you ask if you don't ask, you will have no comment,
but only limited comment. If you ask for code documentation, it will give you the complete
picture right next. Any other
code? Can we integrate
do improvise the code about
It's a random chatty pretty prompt, which I'm trying to explore
right how far we can reach. Right. Certainly there are various improvements.
Any announcements you can do for the code which is mentioned about input validation can be done. One thing dynamic list
you can give and error handling. In the main you can put custom exceptions you can make.
So these are the four options it has provided, right? So any other method available?
Okay. I'm just asking the questions. If any other matter we can go for it.
Just going with this simple conditional alternative method. Right. So this is about how do you do extra
work with that output? Even the documentation is sorted with the help of strategy for the code
or the application of the project with your work. Right. So now we can execute the fourth prompt.
I prefer taking a new check for this. Now let's execute. The fourth prompt which I was discussing
now will execute that first in 3.5 names. So I'm asking a dummy spreadsheet
with four columns which is having name, age, income and city and. Then the rows
of dummy data to be put up in the spreadsheet table. So let's see
it does telling I'm a text based artificial intelligence
so I can automatically create visual elements like spreadsheet. However, I can give you the table.
We just displayed over here. You can what you can do with that. Also, Sterling, you can use Microsoft Excel
or Google Sheets in order to get it into particular format, right?
So the format in the table can be put up in Excel on sheets.
If you want to choose Excel, do you have to do select the date? Now go to send button in the ribbon and
click on the table and you can just make sure you create a table dialog
and you have table had those and click okay, right? So it is giving you an option.
I am not able to do this. Whatever you asked for downloadable Excel format or anything,
but I am a text based person and I can just give you the details here,
but you can proceed making separate Excel or Google Sheet fight. This is how it is
giving the output for given input by the user. Now I am going to a new chat and select
GPT four. Now we are in the jagdeep default and pasting the same prompt which we executed in 3.5.
And let's see what it will tell us. It is working
in the code interpreter format, which I have chosen to do.
Let's see what it will give the output. I then will switch off the code interpreter and check once more
how we do with book. Right? Overall, we are experimenting in this particular program
or in this particular video what all it can do. So here is the dummy data table.
It is providing us after execution. So let's see, let it complete all the ten rules
and what it will suggest as to whether it is downloadable or non downloadable.
How can it be done? See, that is the major difference
between PD 3.5 and four. It is giving the downloadable CSP file
with dummy data access. Right. So what did we ask for? We ask for a spreadsheet, right?
So I'm asking a question. It's my own doubt.
Can we get Excel file
downloaded for the about data
so it not non grammatical how we think, how we write
that's very different. So I've just given the prompt like that. Let's see you can download the dummy data
on Excel format by clicking. Yes, it is giving you a Excel format. Also, it is giving you a CSP format also.
Right? So there is this one. After that point of using activity four,
you can have the downloadable data. So one last thing we want to experiment,
which we discussed is by switching off code interpreter and just taking on before chapter four.
So when you click this, what happens? Let's see.
So it will try to execute. Yes, this is the table it gives you in the format of plain text.
So can you download? Let's wait and watch. It is just giving you copy code.
You can have a copy option already readily available here. So Let's see, after the 10th entry,
can we download the about data?
So I'm just giving go prompt. I'm sorry, but I'm unable to facilitate direct file download.
You can copy the text, you can paste it in your notepad or document or wherever though
a g places. Right. So this is how
it will make some difference when you have the same prompt executed in GPT 3.5 GP four without code interpreter
GP for with the code interpreter option. Right. So this is all the extra use this off
time deputy. Now we are in the last topic of this particular session.
Coding Limitations of ChatGPT
Coding limitations off Chargeability. I'm talking about the limitation with respect to activity 3.5 only.
Okay. So the first thing is lack of beyond though
all four tokens, 2040 tokens. After that you don't have any context.
It will work 3.5 So generating incorrect responses add some instances that happened right
when we tried executing different methods, gave us the same method repeatedly, again as an alternative.
So it goes on in response responses or it goes on and on a loop. If doesn't find any other options.
So sensitive content and bias. So while both at the end reputation, it is having lots of repetition, Again,
the same logic has been repeated over and over again lack of clarification for ambiguous queries.
So it will say I'm not the right person to answer to your committee and you can do so in two options, right? It will probably accept
that it is not happening from it and it is giving an option. How do we explore and go ahead about it?
So non contextual responses also sometimes it will provide domain expertise and specific
knowledge is lacking a little bit, not completely available because it is trained up to one level.
It's not beyond the level. So generating creative or fictional content. So it is having a generation capability,
but only to the limited extent, not the more towards more innovation, more creativity.
It's not. It is having certain limitations. Ashwin Not a replacement for professional advice, right?
Every aspect. It might not think, it might fail to think in every aspect. Humans perspective,
any other consequences, perspective any of the situation. When did the decisions to be made?
So all this cannot happen with the help of tragically right business solutions, business management, product management,
operations management. So inventory management, all these things, we have to decide
how the business is going, what it is happening. Human mind thinking is very different than tangibility thinking
it is not completely matching, but it is trying to match the pinging capacity aspect.
But always it is not the replacement for professional advice. So unpredictable output.
Sometimes it happens. It gives us unpredictable output. It is confusing. We can still ask, question and clarify,
but still as an as gives you unpredictable outputs, it's very difficult to trace back
if it is a bigger program. I'm talking about bigger program aspect. If it is a smaller one modular
one, it's completely fine. We can access it, right? So
these are the core limitations of activity 3.5 in particular.
Now here we are at the last section of the session that this summary let's have a quick recap
of what all be starting in this session. The first thing we studied. What does, though,
Chargeability rule and who is responsible. Don't anticipate it to be developed
that this artificial intelligence, the major domain and the sub domain is been discussed. Introductory discussion happened
after that. We started comparing the competitors starters start CBT and GitHub copilot.
What are the major differences with respect to the premium access, the response to the bronze train dataset, etc.?
Programmers and non programmers who can use the antiquity if at all, if they want to use what are the pros and cons of using it?
They will extend everything and then many other prompts were demonstrated with respect
to building the code, debugging the code, handling the exceptions, testing
code, documentation, all The demonstrations were done. Apart from these, we had extra users.
Also, we tried creating our table, our dummy data,
certain entries inside it, and we also saw the differences, how the same prompt
will be executed in GBP 3.5 and GBP four, which is having access
to download the file in default, which is not present in 3.5. Right.
So at last we saw a few of the limitations with respect to the architecture training data.
Well, both are reputation sensitive content, be, etc. enchanted with 3.5 by this
we end the session Happy learning. Thank you. Now let's see how to give the prompt
Build Python App using ChatGPT 4o
to watch activity. I will start telling I want to build a game app
that is rock, paper, scissors. Let my back and B python and friends.
B hits HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I want to execute this on an online
editor, namely the applet. So this is r instruction constraint
because here I'm telling that I want to develop a rock paper Caesar game
where python is my backend and head stand mel c s and JavaScript being friend.
So we are setting up context here. So this is all about what we want to
develop. Next is I want this for the target of college students
and it should be for early professionals as well. So let it be simple and easy to execute.
So this is where I am setting audience pattern and the overall context is say pure.
Then let the creation of this be very interactive and with simple explanation
and a step by step process which helps me understand and create these easily.
So this is our overall context that we are setting here. So I wanted be very interactive
so that it will tell me what to do step wise. Then please help me connect
both frontend and backend goods easily and explain everything from scratch.
So this is again an instruction. So this is my entire prompt which I want to give it to my TED pitti.
So I will copy paste this prompt to my ted gpp here.
So I will go to my activity and I will give prompt. If you want to know more about
how to write these prompts in detail, you can take up. Of course some are create learning platform
and it is prompt engineering. So now let us execute this prompt
when I give this prompt. So this is what ATP gives me back.
So sure, let's create an interactive rock paper sees it app using flask. At the backend.
And hits the MLC as his job. Also different than here, it's giving me step by step guide the follow.
So it is telling me to sign in or log in to the pledge dot com. I will show you a demo
of how the prompt decoding works in a moment. But first let's go through the basic setup
for our friend and we are using hit statement to structure our game system.
Stylish and JavaScript to add interactive would be hence HTML will help us
create the grid for the rock paper scissors game. See us. This will make it look appealing
and JavaScript will handle the game logic such as detecting clicks and revealing winners
on the backend. We will be using flask a lightweight python. Web framework
Flask will serve our frontend. Files and handle the game logic on this. Server side.
This setup allows to build a fully functional web app with Python.
We are going to use RIP LED and online code editor to run right and.
Are could. Replicate makes it easy to collaborate. And share your. Projects with others.
Now I will walk you through. The steps. Building the rock. Paper scissors. Game.
We will. Start by setting up different then face. Then move on to the back
end with flask and connect everything. Together. So here
I can go to Google and I can log in and do my own. I have already logged in
so you can create one account for your own. So this is my duplicate account. Next it is telling me to create
a new project. So it is telling me to click on the create button Juice flask as the template so.
I can go and. Click on the creator applet option here. I should select FLASK
as an option that your template. Now I have to give a title to it. So what can we give?
We can give it as rock, paper, scissors, game
app. Okay, so now creative. Let
now once you click on Create it, open a new page for us.
So now here we will be copy pasting Art. Good. So we'll see what is our next step? Our next step is to set up the backend
at this python with flask so we have to open may not be right and copy this.
That is your python. So click on copy code here, go to our triplet. So this is our main dot b way.
So here I am copy pasting my code which I have got it from chatting with it. Next after this step
it is it telling us the step three that is to set up this printing. So set up this.
Then we have to create template folder first. So let me go back and I am in main by now and here
there is an option of new folder. So click on this new folder and name with us templates.
Okay. Now it is also telling me create new folder named templates.
Inside of this folder we have to create a file named index dot hitch dammit.
So I'll copy the same name and I'll go back and here it is telling me file so I will copy paste my HTML file now.
So I've created an index dotted HTML file now next after creating good at this,
telling me to add DML code, so I will just copy this code and I will paste it here in my head.
HTML file that this index dot hits the limit. Okay, We'll see what we have to do next.
Next it is telling me to create static folder, so I'll go on the main dot b right
click on main, but by again create a new for good by name static.
Okay. And inside we have to create two files now. So one is style dot
cases I will name will file as static dot cases.
So now after naming my one file, they must see this other file name is dot G is.
I will create another file inside this
by name. Script dot JS. I have created two files inside
static folder now. So now I to access code.
So I have to copy my thesis code and I will go to my thesis file and I will pasting code here next.
Next it is telling me to add in JavaScript code, so let me copy the JavaScript code from here
and I will click on the JavaScript file and let me paste my code here.
Next, we will see what it is telling. So step four is nothing but running the application on the plate.
So before we run into our execution. Let us see the main gist of what
these files are now. So this is the python file that you are setting, the actual context
where it is actually playing rock, paper, scissors and all of that, taking the input from the user hedge
DML file that is used for structuring your code so your entire web
page will be set up using this DML structure. Then is your CCIS where you are styling
your entire web page, and then is your JavaScript, which helps you to interactively connect
everything on your code that you are developing. So now once you understand the gist about it,
I will move on to our step four. That is your running the application under the blade. So to run
we have to just this run button on top of this triplet. Then you can access the game is what it is telling.
So now I will go here and I will run.
So when I run this code, you can see that you have got an output.
So it is dealing rock paper sees it. So if I click on rock, it can tell you just rock.
But computer also chose rock, so it does that night. So when I click paper
you adjust the paper but computer rock, so you win. So this is how you can get the output
for a single player computer being your another player. So now we will actually define our code
and we will refine our code of using TAG to be better for two players.
So I am just giving the prompt as rock paper scissors should be for two person game.
So when I give this prompt here again, it will refine the code. I need to give me the code
so some believe will copy paste all code of Python HD MLC assist and Java
from here on this same document. That we. Have created. So copy the python code.
I go here and I will paste it in my python file. So select all select wheat.
So I pasted it here. Now. Next, let me copy HD html code.
So copy could go back to on the plate in your head DML file.
Let me paste the hatch DML code next. It is giving me the exclusion,
so copy the code, go back to the plate, go to your CSV file and paste your Cisco
and then go back to your to ATP and copy your JavaScript code.
Get back to our applet. Let me paste my JavaScript.
So after doing everything, let me run my project now, right? So let me run.
So when you click on your run button again, you got your new output
for two different layers. So play add one. Let me choose Rock and it is telling
waiting for the other player player to let me choose paper so it'll tell people
is the winner, right? So it'll be player two is the winner like this. You can test for any number of options.
You will get the output as who is the winner in particular option or game.
So this is how you can develop the app using chat.
You think as we reach the end of this video, I hope you now have a clear understanding
of how to develop a simple game app using drag you would be prompt and Python.
The key takeaway is to. Break down the task into manageable. Steps and limit
the part of charge you need. Guide you through Each stage will be using SDM,
C, assist and JavaScript as are basic programing languages. The coding playground of choice
be an online editor one computer for chatting with default by our side.

Political Amnion. We're going to explain you today. A new topic using ChatGPT.
Introduction ToText Summarization
What is it? Let me give you a hint. Unlocking the Essence. One sentence at a time. Is the art of text summarization?
Yes, you are correct. We're going to understand that summarization using centipede.
So let's get started. What we're going to cover today at Agenda is first we're going to discuss
introduction to text, summarization and. Then we're going to understand
X summarization using 20. So introduction to text summarization. So text summarization
in natural language processing is the process of creating a shortened version of given text
while retaining its most important information. It involves automatically extract
or generating a concise summary that captures the key ideas and main points of the original text.
The goal of text summarization, even in an LP, is to help users quickly grasp
the essence of a document without highlighting to read the entire text.
Thereby saving time and effort, doesn't it? It plays a crucial role in information
retrieval, decision making and efficient consumption of textual data.
So this is all about text summarization, a brief about text summarization novel going to understand
more about this using dedicated after the introduction to text summarization.
Let's understand the concept using Jedi. So now we're going to understand
the steps, the basic steps of text summarization using Python
on a given text, but before that will understand what are those steps. So as you can see that over here,
I have given a prompt that is a step to perform text summarization on a given day using python.
So can see that first step over here is what before you can see. One explanation is also there.
The text summarization is a challenging task that involved considering main point of a given text
in the short evolution. There are different approaches to the text summarization basically.
So there are multiple libraries, which we can use for summarizing the text. But as you can see here,
we have some limited libraries using that we're going to summarize our text
based on a given text. First step is installing required libraries.
As I said, you ensure that you have all the necessary libraries
for summarizing the text. Next is to popular libraries for text summarization
and in teaching and denizli. So here you can see first we'll have to install the analytical.
Then after we're going to import more libraries, which is required. For. Pre-Processing the text.
So first is the stop work, which is the part of analytical corpus.
Then anybody can tokenize, which is used to tokenize the sentence into tokens
and they will going to import what tokenize and send tokenize. What are basically
they going to tokenize the word find means. Then will tokenize the sentences.
Next is obviously the last library which is used for summarizing the whole text.
So now third is there will come to be proxies that text. Suppose if you want perform
any necessary processing steps are what you are going to do. You will going to remove
the unnecessary characters and converting the whole text into lowercase.
You're going to remove the stock, stop what you will, going to tokenize the sentences in two sentences or words, as I can see
over here by using this library that you can do that. So here you can see the tokenized import.
What tokenized and tokenized basically is used to convert or will use
to tokenize the text in Dawson Bouzid onwards. Now the next is
here is an example of pre-processing using kit. So what we are doing,
we are converting the text into lowercase. We are removing all the unnecessary characters
which we have in the text, and then after we're going to tokenize in two sentences,
Then after we're going to return tokenized sentence, after that we're going to remove this stuff.
This is the next step to pre-processing the text. So in this what we're going to do, stop,
What are the common words that do not carry much meaning and
can be removed to improve the summarization process? So here
analytically provide a list of a stop word that you can use. Here is an example
how to remove stop words. And this is the complete code for removing this stop words.
Now, this goal going to apply it on the text. Basically, from there,
we want to remove all the unwanted words and all the unnecessary words,
which generally the part of stop float and which is not required during the summarization.
After that we're going to generate that somebody. So basically what we are doing here,
we are pre-processing. The tags we are producing the text means we are removing all the unwanted text
basically from the text. And at last they applied the final code
to get the summary. So here you can use a summarization method to generate the summary.
And here the summarized function from dead simple white. A simple way to perform Extractives
here and here is an example for that. You can see using this code what we are doing
that we have separate sentences and add the summarization part, we're going to join that single text
into a formal sentence and that complete part will going to
convert into summary. So the last is then they did the summary. So for that we're going to use this code.
Somebody is basically what you can use summarization method for that to generate the summary. The final part,
the summarize function we're going to use in that and that's summarize function, basically use
to summarize to get the important text out of the whole text.
What what we are using in this for text summarization. So this is all the combined code,
what we have already discussed here. Now, this is the basic example of text
summarization. Using a selective method, you can enhance the summarization
by using other techniques, like the idea of what I'm building or neural network models.
So as I said earlier, there are a lot of multiple ways to do the slide back summarization.
So today we are discovering one of the technique and how to perform the text summarization
by using this change between how it is so easy to use or to understand the text summarization
by using categories. So let's understand that part. Now we're going to apply
the big summarization technique. We're going to apply all the code. What we have here
on a on a particular text. So let's start that and understand
how to perform text summarization. Now, we have discussed about all the steps
Basic Steps for Text Summarization
which is required for X summarization. Now we're going to implement those steps
on some text to get the summarize form. So here you can see I have given a prompt
that Python code to perform back summarization on the given text. So you can see that
the text is actually too long and we'll going to understand how to perform summarization
on this given text step by step. So let's understand that. So when I run this prompt,
what I am getting is an output over here. So here you can see that we have a code
based on the prompt, what we share in do. And as you can see,
that first is we are importing all required libraries. Then after we are using the text
on which we are going to process all the pre-processing dusk, then after what we are doing,
we are tokenizing the text into sentence. We are talking to tokenizing the sentence
into word by using this analytic word tokenize function. We are converting that whole text
into lowercase by using lower function. Then after as this is
the part of pre-processing we have to remove all the unnecessary characters
and you can see that we are removing all what here. All these top words.
So common word with little meaning. If you really want to understand more about
stop what you can just ask over as a prompt that what is
basically stop words are subjectivity will give you a complete explanation of stop as well.
But in brief I can see that that those words which have little meaning
and which is not required in the text. So we are removing all those text
and which we call stop loss by using this code. Then after we can see that filtered words
and have applied over here that complete code for that. Then after what we are doing,
we're creating the frequency of each word. So based on the frequency
or level going to decide that which word should be there in the summary.
Then after the next step is applying the sentences based the sum of word frequencies,
and this is the complete code for that summary length. Then how many number of sentences
you want in your desired summary? So this is a complete code which we are getting as an output
through gender. Now you can see that here this is the complete explanation.
Also we have for this is, as I said, encoding the necessary libraries.
Then after downloading the required and only resource is using and the download function
assign the text to be summarized to text where you will Then after tokenize the text sentences
and how we're going to use that send underscore tokenize function.
After that tokenize the sentence in the word so holy sign this voice will get organized
into a sentence that holds and this is will get tokenized into word by using word underscore tokenized,
and then after we convert them into lowercase. Next step is
removing the stop word from the word using a list comprehension, then going to talk about its words more.
But first we're going to implement this code into collab node work
that whether we are getting a correct output using this code or not. Now, as you can see over here, that
after removing a stop words, we are calculating the frequency of each word using frequency
based function that frb, q DSP for this function.
Then the sentences based on the sum of what frequency and store the score in the
as a school dictionary said the desired somebody some brilliant is basically is what
the number of send is you want in the summary present is as a summary you want
and this is the summary you want. So based on that, we will give the number over that and we'll get the output.
Then the total as a step over here, select the top ranks and this is using and largest from hip Q
and construct the summary By joining those send selected sentences will spaces
and then after we'll go to print that whole summary. So basically what we are doing here for
we are importing the required libraries. Then we will going apply the pre-processing on a given text
and then after we'll going to summarize the whole text by after the stop words and unnecessary
categories. And at last we'll get the summary by using summary function
summarized function. So let's understand that what gold we are getting over here.
So now let's implement the code. What we have seen here
inside in colon node books. And when we implement that, we want to actually see that
that the output, what we are getting is correct or not. So as you can see,
I have copied the whole code over here and when I will run this code, let's then
this code I'm getting over here somebody and how many sentences I'm getting over
here is three sentences wide. The reason is I have given the summary length over here. Three.
Let's see if I give four over here and when I will run this code,
I will get I will get the full sentences and force and this is will get joint
and give you a proper summary based on fault. So we have understood
the text summarization each and every code offered and we have implemented as well
that in the column notebook just to get the confirmation whether we are getting the output or not.
So we're going to understand the combined explanation, what I discussed with you
in the step, so in step by step will understand each and everything. So will give you better clarity
that what we have done in text summarization. So I have given the prompt over here
for that. The write the above code step by step with explanation. When you give this prompt,
you will get all the code and in us separately take in step by step
you will get each and every code and finally you will get the explanation of each step.
So first is import the required library. So the libraries we have to give there
because once we implement the library, then only you will be able to pre process that as you will be able
to summarize the text by using these libraries. So first is Analytical library,
which is used for what? Natural language processing. Thus processing task means like tokenisation
stop removal, etc.. Second is over from an eligible corpus.
So you not only get not corpus, it provide of common.
To be removed from the text. So now will understand what that is document because here
you can see the desktop words basically over here provide a list of common words.
What are those common words are? So when I ask. Said.
You beauty that what Aristotle would
do, you can see as an output over here is the above quote stop
would refer to a set of commonly used words in language that often carry little
or no meaningful information when it comes to naturally, language processing
look like summarization. What we are doing, these words are like the is between
and to kind of English words, which has no meaning in terms of
if we want somebody of a particular task because in text summarization, the meaning of exclamation in itself
is to summarize the whole text and to get the meaningful information out of the complete text.
So in the code stop one module, which is the part of analytical library,
basically a set of stop worked specific to the English language and stop
what that word English you will here you can see that a function we product a set of English stop
which is actually which has no meaning or which has no importance in terms of summarization.
By removing this dog word from the text, you can that before that summarization we have to remove it
and we can focus on the most important part of the text. Now the next is the line code food.
Then what over there, which will going to see the meaning of that filter. Word is over here is to get the words
which will get filtered out through after removing the Stanford. So then I will go back to the code.
As you can see here, that tag, if it is giving you
the explanation of stop for after that. Here you can see that next one is free.
This we come to that free filtered world. But before that,
let me explain you the next module which will go to user. What here is free
this because frequency distribution. We already discussed that, but we're going to understand
this in more detail. So by this use it is used to calculate
the distribution of what next is. We are going and we are going to use hip Q
which is basically what used to select the top the length sentences
based on their scores. So we have already imported all the libraries.
Next step was what now? The next step is we're going to define the text, which will going to be some way.
So we have already discussed about the text as when the text variable is stored in put text that we want to summarize
for the step is to organize the text in two sentences and which will obviously convert,
which will tokenize all these text in Lucentis and it will break the text
into individual sentences because we had actually in the starting the combined paragraph,
we're going to tokenize that into separate sentences
and then we going to store them in the sentences list. After that, once we'll get all this.
And then separately we're going to break those sentences in to what how we're going to do that
by using what underscore tokenize function. So here we are applying
that only we're going to implement that word. And this called organize function on an
on the previous school, basically on the sentences. And we tokenize that sentence into what
after doing that you can see parallelly we are converting those what in the law is by using functions
and all function is basically used to convert all the capital letter words with copied and initiate
everything into lowercase. Now the resulting void where we get to store in your list
as we were storing the sentences in the sentences list, here we are restoring the word tokenized word into word list after that.
Now, once we get all these tokenized word, what we're going to do, the next step would be removing Stanford.
We have already discussed what are what is, and that's a step in that same code
we are seeing over here. This filtered one, the filter, what we were discussing that I don't do will
to discuss more about it. So here filter what are what after removing after getting the start,
what will get the complete set of stop words and then we will going to remove that.
And once we remove all the stop word from the tags from the list of what what we have
at the end, the remaining word which which we get as an output will Dundas Over here
we are giving the name for those words as a filtered words. So next step would be calculating
the frequency of each word. I have already discussed this, but I'm explaining now
step by step just to get the more clarity on it. So next step calculate the frequency of each word
by using. I discussed and I told you earlier that this is a function
which is used to get the frequency, each word. Based on that we're going to understand.
We're going to decide which board will going to use as if somebody will hold include in a somebody.
Now the rank beside this based on what frequencies higher the frequency we get, the higher chance
will be the part of the summary. So here this is called dictionary is initialized restored the score of each sentence.
We are creating a dictionary over here back and basically what here calibrates is basically what it is
actually the dictionary only. And here we will going to obtain all the score of each sentence.
Now for each side is in the sentences list. The words are tokenize and convert into lowercase.
So we are doing the same here. And then after if a word is present in word frequency.
So if it is present in the dictionary, then it's frequencies added to the score of the correspond sentence
in center to score. Then after we will going to set the desired summary land. That's how many sentences
you want in a somebody. Somebody land is equal to three. We are giving it up to you, as I said earlier.
Well, and at last we will get the final somebody based on the length what we are deciding over here.
So now here you can see that we are going to implement those good step by step.
Text Summarization using ChatGPT
Earlier, we have seen the output we were getting, the output but we have applied the whole coded ones.
Now we're going to apply step by step. So you will get at the end of each step of what output you are getting.
So we have applied all the we have implemented all the libraries. We have
given the text, which we are going to summarize. And then you see that
we are converting these, complete the complete text into sentences.
Then I run this code, I'm getting all these sentences like the complete paragraph
into the formal sentences. Then after the next step would be to break the sentences in to what?
So then I will run. Discord. We break those and this is in like.
So we are getting all these and it is now in the form of words. Basically, we are tokenizing the sentence
into what once we get all the verbs organized, what are going to apply the stop
word function? It is used to remove the stop word from this given or tokenized word,
and at the end we will get the word Venable underscore. You can see that here
we are getting only the usable word. Meaningful What? Except those the is between
all kind of stop words that has been removed from here. We only have the filtered word
because we only have the meaningful with those which is actually required for our summary.
Next is we are going to calculate now the frequency. So when I will run this code,
I will get the sentence scored. So here you can see that the full sentence is this one.
So then you will see what is this code of the sentence, this 118 118.
Then I will check the other one. The other one has 87.
See the next sentence has the frequency 73, the other 441 has Hamlet 70.
So here we are getting the score of the sentence, are getting the frequency of the sentence.
Now we have the frequency based on this length, they get the final summary
and how will they define this somebody First we have to decide how many number of sentences
you want in your desired somebody. So here I have given three and then after will going, to understand
what we're going to select the doubling sentences based on the frequency, as I already shown you.
And we're going to bring the list top ranked and this is as a summary over here.
So when I will run this code, I'm getting them doubling time position in the form of somebody.
And here joint function I'm using because obviously three sentences if I'm getting
I don't want in the form of sentences v I that in the form of paragraphs. So I'm going to join that three sentences
of runtime business and that will be a joint and we'll show you in the form of a summary in the formal paragraph.
So here you can see the first sentence. Then the second sentence is this one, and the third one
is the quarterly profits of these trees. And these are the topline sentences which I have you on
which I have joined using join function. So that's how you can do the next summarization using.
Jenji Beatty And it's very easy to understand, I suppose if you're stuck somewhere in some good,
you can simply just copy that code as a prompt and ask Liberty
the complete detailed explanation of that and you will get a proper and exact explanation.
So based on that, it's vital. Understanding the theory, you are implementing that theory in a practical way as well.
So it is actually time saving for us then. So let's
end this part and we'll discuss the summary. What we have learned till now
is really going to understand about data analysis, but not to a normally usual process.
Introduction to Data Analysis using ChatGPT
We're going to understand how to use JWT to analyze a data. So let's get started.
As you know, would be introduction to data analysis. The difference between GDP 3.5 and four,
applying goods to analyze a dataset and then applying Excel commands to analyze
a dataset on which we're going to analyze the whole meaning now and start understanding the introduction
to read analysis. What is data analysis is So data analysis is a matter of inspecting, cleaning,
transforming and modeling data to discover useful information, conclusion
and simple decision making. There are management steps that comes under data analysis process.
Such is what data collection. Second is data cleaning and pre-processing. No one would we exclude data analysis,
then data transformation and then model building after the evaluation and the last interpretation.
So next we're going to understand difference between DPD 3.5 and DPD for
one, discussing about difference between both. Because we're going to
apply the data analysis process, we're going to understand IT analysis process using, DPD Force,
which is a latest Aboriginal genocide DPD. And before we start working on that,
you should understand why we are not working on 3.5. That is a original.
So there are few differences between 3.5 to do 3.5 and 4/4.
Difference is the credibility. Four is multimodal and has more processing power
compared to GDP. 3.5 Know what it is.
So the major limitation of GDP t 3.5 was that it was the uni morning.
Now what is uni what it is? And they of judge would only understand
and interpret text input instead put before you'll be able to apply
more advanced features such. As you can upload the images, you can upload the whole dataset
and you can basically upload images there. So not even text,
but you can apply more advanced features using 24.
So which we cannot do in 3.5. Second one is Jupyter. It is more accurate than 23.5.
So in terms of accuracy, also the 2024 version working more correctly than 3.5 24
can solve various problems and equations in subject as varied as calculus, geometry
and and double digit B to 3.5, on the other hand, can only give us the direction
like how to solve the problem. And rather than providing the actual solution, there.
So that's why we follow nowadays tend to be deferred, which work better than 2.5.
So here you can see two options. You you put a 3.5 and we do four.
So basically, as you put it, 3.5 here if you want to upload and it doesn't, it's not possible
because we do not have the file option. You can ask,
Judge, if you have any question, if you want to analyze the data
you can ask by using text only. But in CBT four you are getting an option
to upload sites. So here for us, we're going to upload the dataset which we want to perform data.
And then based on that, we ask Judge if we do for using some props.
So let's get a started. So after uploading the dataset,
Data Analysis using Python - Outline
we're going to understand how to load the data. What is the process of data analysis, as we discussed earlier,
that there are various steps that should go work on a data analysis, will understand those.
Then step by step flows and then we'll move to the final analysis of the dataset.
Basically that is got busy over here. So for the X was we ask did you do that?
What are the steps that should be covered in data analysis by using a prompt? So when I know
the ground over here that is what are the various steps to analyze the data.
You can see that the data beautiful. We show you all the steps
that should be covered during the analysis process. So first is understanding the problem statement.
Then after data loading, then after excluded, it analyzes. That is deep exploration
and understanding that has some properties today which we'll discuss.
And then after data cleaning, feature engineering and data visualization.
So these are all steps that should come under data analysis process. Next, understand
the first step Understanding the problem statement. So understanding the problem statement is what Basically
you have to understand what you will achieve from the analysis. So you first you have to understand the
how many columns do you have in the data, How many rows do you have in your data would be based on about what
second is data loading to load the data into city, which structure to begin the analysis.
Then after data acceleration and understanding that goals Summary
that covered missing values that cover duplications know like some duplicate values out of there
that we have to remove, then you degrade analysis by weight analysis. What all are these
basically forces data summaries that in this we get a summary of the data
to understand its structure value and basic statistic. So basically it's about to understand
the whole structure of dataset on which we're going to analyze. So it covers basically how many rows
do you have in the dataset, how many columns do you have in the dataset and the mean of the
columns and the median of the column, the standard deviation, because these all are
very important factors, that should be covered during analysis. Second step is missing values.
So basically this missing value, basically what it's about the check,
is that any missing values are present in the data. If missing values are there, you will not get the clarity at the end
of prediction, at the end of modeling the data. After modeling the data, you will not get the exact output,
you will not get the exact prediction. So meeting value should not be there if missing values.
And then for that we will follow another process that we'll discuss later.
After that comes univariate. But before that, I want to add one more point over here,
which we are not getting in this, but that should be what duplication. So if suppose in a column
we have duplicate data, same data, but there should not be duplicate. Okay, that should be set things.
So in that case we have to impute that duplicate rules and select
so that also we will check. And then after we come to your new data analysis,
analyze it single variable, basically analyzing each column, each variable
that comes under univariate. For that, we have lots of jobs through which we can analyze.
And then after Bivariate analyzes, using different different plots, we get analyze the BIVARIATE analysis,
which is basically what analyzing the relationship between two variables. So if you are analyzing a single variable, for an example,
a single column, okay, like me, if you want to analyze the name of the guys, different cards
we have, suppose in the got ambiguity, does it? If you want to analyze how many cards we have
and suppose if you want to understand that. So MPG like that particular column,
what we're going to see after this so single variable, if you want to analyze
that, will come under univariate If you want to compare between two variables, we want to check relationship between two very much.
In that case, we'll follow the by weighted analysis for that. Also we have various blocks through which we can perform
this analysis. Next step is data cleaning. So basically data cleaning is
what did the cleaning see? If you have some missing values, you have some duplicate values.
So you have to clean the data because once you clean the data, then only you will be able to get the correct prediction.
Then you would be able to model the data and you can model the data. But the thing is,
you will not be able to get the correct prediction based on that modeling of data. So here, before the data modeling,
we have to clean the data properly. So here first step comes
handling missing values, imputing or removing missing value. Either you can remove or
you can imbued with average value mode or median.
So basically here it depends on the data, the values. If they are very important,
if you cannot remove those values there, we have to imbue with some other values. And if it is okay
to remove those missing values, then we can remove and it depends on the dataset, what we are using there.
And the values are very important. So we will keep that and we'll impute those missing values
with some other statistical value. Basically. Next, this outlier treatment
identifying and treating outliers if necessary. So basically, what is outlier over here, the value
which is completely different if we compare with other best of values.
So here if some outlier are there, so that also we have to treat.
So the next point in the data transformation. So data transformation is what converting data in do
required for me. Now what is this basically here data transformation when we required this
for an example if you have a column with the name name
the name should be in the form of single digit, Correct. But if the data type
of that particular column is an invisible, so basically the data type of the column is
these are that obviously we should change that to string. So if
the data is not into the required format. So there we have to transform the data.
So these three steps actually comes under the cleaning process. After that will do feature
engineering, creating new features that might help in analysis of market,
that will understand properly when we perform these steps.
Then after comes data visualization so that they visualize the data
using various stats. As I said earlier, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis
so that actually these analysis we generally perform to visualization
by visualizing this in different various plot and here visualization
using histogram Baader we can do and visualization relationship that we can do using
scatterplot correlation matrices to heal univariate analysis can but one through histogram bar chart
and if you want to understand the relationship between two variables, basically that we call by weight analysis
so that you can do that you can perform using the scatterplot, using heatmap, also using coalition matrices.
Now the next step comes statistical analysis, performing the statistical best
to understand relationship significance of sector model building. The next step there, we will build
predictive model using machine learning on statistical methods. So basically depends on the which
step of data are using so based on that will perform values relevant to the modeling.
So next is interpretation. After modeling the data will get the predictions,
we'll get the final output. And based on that, we're going to interpret basically the conclusion
what is the end result of the whole process, What we have performed
then after report and communicate findings, basically presenting the finding in a clear and understandable manner,
the stakeholder basically is like the who. You're going to report that whole analysis to them.
It should be very clear because you know that the dialysis might be possible the person to whom you will want to show
that complete picture. You might not understand the process, what you have followed. So you have to present in a very clear
and very precise manner basically the outcome. So these are the process that comes under data analysis.
And we you follow this process and step by step will understand how to perform this.
Understanding the Car-MPG Dataset
So now the next step is, as we have already discussed about the process, like how to perform data analysis,
all the steps we have on this, you will perform those steps one by one. And the first under
that process is how to load the dataset and will understand about the whole data
what we will going to analyze before we do that, once we click on upload site
and then really upload the dataset. So here our dataset is got empty.
We don't know as of now what is basically this got images and what is on them.
After uploading the dataset, we're going to understand by using the prompt, we're going to ask
a few prompts. Based on that we get an output. So first prompt we're going to enter
over here is so as you can see here, we have uploaded the dataset now will understand about this data first.
So before that we're going to enter a prompt here. We are giving a prompt.
The prompt is basically what we want to know to check what we want to understand, which we do.
Here we are asking that load the current nested which we have uploaded
and displayed the first end rules. What information is contained in this dataset. So let's do this
and let's see what output we'll get over here.
So you can see that we are getting the Python code also here. And you can see here that
using this head function we are getting that output. And finally
we are getting the information of all the variables which we have in the required dataset,
then start to begin. So first is what we asked. We have us to load the dataset,
so check the beautiful files will load the dataset and we are asking over here,
that is video for Istanbul's. So by using this head function, the output will be here.
I will show you the ten starting rules of big data. So we are getting this starting
then those simultaneous we will apply this code Jupyter also that whether we'll get the correct output
into a notebook or not. So that also we will check. But as of now we discussed
what we are getting is a multiple of here. So now as we can see, we are getting starting then rules.
Now we want to understand the whole dataset. So this complete current dataset
is having then columns, then variables basically force this and busy mpg
that is fuel efficiency. Then after cylinder that is see y l number of cylinders in the engine.
Then after this that is engine displacement which is in cubic. And just then at speed that is how spot
then W2 that is weight of the car it is in forms after that is that is acceleration
second required to be 60 mph. Next is why are that is model either
as a two digit number example 72 1970 basically nine would be what it would be 70.
So next is origin, that is origin code. It might represent different region or countries
then of the car type that type of car for which we are doing this analysis.
So type of car example zero might represent one category and one might represent
and got me the last variable that is name of the car, which basically include make and model.
Now this dataset be useful varies and that is it just is understanding the relationship between fuel efficiency
and that attribute all classify car based on the characteristics here what we will go in doing this and then we
to understand the relationship between fuel efficiency and of energy. Okay, so let's
write this code in Jupiter. This let's see that whether we are getting the output that or not.
So when we copy this code, you can copy directly from here and it when you click over here
you can get copied and. Then you can paste this code in Jupiter notebook so you can see
I have already pasted the code, I have uploaded the dataset over here. I have given the dataset name
which should be in this environment over here because we are using the command lead in the resources.
So if you are uploading the dataset, which is the extension of CSP, then there
you have to use this command that is reading these courses and then you can see that we are getting all these
columns over here. Now the next is over here you can see that we want to check the stopping force
rules. So what code for that. So basically here we have this code that got empty and did not had.
So then it be stored here. Good. Let's see. What else can we get over here?
So here we are getting what first is so this one that whatever the code we have at last
comparable displayed only. So here the last code is not had function we are giving and based on
that we are getting starting again because that function is basically you start in barrels if you want to see more rules
this enter the value inside the correct. So if I want to check let's see 20 rules.
So if I do these yet I am getting 0 to 19. That means when you lose data.
So head function is basically what will display the number of rules based on the value
what you are giving inside the parenthesis. Now next is what.
So next is to display the data type of all the variables from the about dataset,
because we want to know the type of the data which we are using in the BBC. So for
we will ask you by using this prompt, you can enter, you can give any wrong as per your ease.
So as if not, I'm giving over here that display the data type of all the variables from the above DNS it.
So when we enter this prompt we'll get some output. So let's see what we are getting over here is an output.
I'm getting the code also, which is in Python. God knows what could be done,
which is the mean and did be typed is the function
basically used to understand used to get the output based on beta type.
So you can see here we are getting the result. That first variable is offload.
Another is of ENDESA, another one is against load, one is object, that is XP, that is all spot.
Then after weight is off in this area type and so on. So here you are
getting a complete exclamation So and the data will do very well in the current data set out as follows.
So we are getting all these so complete explanation. What Next
is showing here it is. It's worth noting that XP column is of type object, which might indicate
some irregularities in the data so such is missing value on non numeric entries. If we need to perform
numerical analysis on this column, we have to clean and convert it to the numeric data back.
Now why we are getting this? Because if you want to perform analysis and then unless this is medical BS,
so in that case we have to convert. And if you are converting a variable in
to some other data type before there you have to check whether we have missing values or not.
So for we will going to apply some other code there and let's
see what output will get to that stage. As of now, we are skipping this part
because any which way is we going to check whether we have missing values or not. And during that process
we check this column to understand how to build the missing that is in non.
So here we are checking all the columns and simultaneously
we are checking the type of the data. So this is the final output.
If I apply this code in Jupiter notebook, let's see whether
we are getting a correct or not. Already we have we would have this course. I used it over here
whenever we run this code, it's after applying this code, I can see that we are getting the output
and here what we are getting is an output. We are getting all the type of the data does
based on the code which we have given here. So empty is flawed.
Data type set cylinder is off. These are data type same as we use
of, of dictator type and so on. So yeah, this is correct. And as of now, whatever
we are getting good to tidy would be showing the correct output. Now let's understand the next step.
So the next step is if you want to check is that any duplicate rules.
So that is also very important step during analysis duplicates. This should not be the missing one.
You should not be there. So as a prompt, I'm giving here basically the duplicate clause from the about exact using python
viva is specifically mentioned over here. Python because we want python. Good as if not useful.
But actually we are specifically mentioned here using python. When I enter this code I'm getting some output.
Let's what else we are getting.
Okay. So as a good what we are getting over here that find
basically you are forced we have to create a very well obviously so the name of the variable
in which the output will get is store is a duplicate under the square rules
and we are getting the code over here that from the data got MP two data
get the duplicate values. So for that we are using your duplicated function.
You can see one parenthesis of what he is about and this is there. That means that is a function.
So publicly did we have a pattern that is duplicated is a function which we are applying on the data
and that basically take out all the duplicate values will show you complete obligate values.
Why would we have what would be good values are present the dataset so
then it will get restored the duplicate underscore rows. Then we will call that variable and we get the output as an output.
Here What we are getting that the empty dataframe columns are these many columns.
What would we have already in the dataset? And as an interpretation and as a final result?
What a tidy bit is showing here that the empty dataset doesn't contain any duplicate rules only,
and these in the dataset are unique there is no duplication.
So we can go ahead with this dataset. As of now, if you have any specific questions or you can ask.
So now I really want to check whether we are getting the same output when I apply the same code
in the vehicle. So then I copied Escort Beast over here.
Let's see what else we will get.
There is nothing. Basically, we do not have any duplicate tools. Okay, let's go ahead with the other step
and we apply one more prompt here.
Now the next prompt I leave all what he had is display the categorical
and convenience that variable will in the dataset using Python vi because I want to know
that how many categorical variables do we have you How many continuous value? One do we have you
Then I enter this prompt. Let's see what output we are getting.
Okay. So as we advised over here that the categorical and contain instead of limited does a python,
we are not asking what is categorical and continuous, but is still we are getting output
based on the explanation that David is giving over here. Is that categorical variable are those
that can pick on one of limited set of values representing categories or labels
by continuous can pick on an infinite set of values within that range based on the data type
and the nature of the value. What we can identify categorical and continuous variable. So categorical
even said basically what variable that are typically in these are are object type and represent
discrete categories and containers is basically what which are typically float
type and represent continuous measurements. So now here you can see the code
based on the brand. What have under so categorical variable as created
in which we are storing the output and output based on what
that selected type include object in. So we are asking if the
values are of object and in these are stored that column names in this variable
that is categorical value. It is the variable inside of slot phenotype
then is stored. Those column names is the form of list, because here you can see that we are
giving a column that bullet. So basically the columns will convert to list and that we're going to store
with instantaneous variable that it would basically. Okay. So now here
removing the column that are known to be continuous, what are we presented as in PISA
that is equal so the categorical variable or remove from the list.
Now when we display, when we ask a categorical very is very well
what we get as an output, this is the output. So based on the data on this, categorical variables are
these many are the categorical variables and these are convenience variables
because based on continuous and categorical, will perform the data analysis except supplied this call once
and let's see what output we are getting in Jupiter Notebook
I'll get to first is categorical. So first list is based on categorical variables.
The another one we are asking the convenience management. So another list is what
of convenience label? So we are getting a critical one here next.
And this time the next block of data analysis. Whether do we have missing
values in the dataset or not, or if have, and how to build that missing values.
Because if we have a missing values, that will impact the final outcome.
So if you have missing that is in your data. So you have to impute those missing values with some
other values like how that will understand after this. Okay, so the next one is
Car-MPG - Distribution of Origin Variable
the distribution of the origin variable. How does the origin affect the other feature in the dataset? Let's understand this also.
When I enter this prompt regarding output
or leading variable in the defensive is like the categorical variable representing different region
or countries of origin, because we can visualize this distribution using a bot
not to show the frequency of each category. Once we have an understanding of the distribution,
we can further explore how the origin affects other features in the dataset,
why we are using this feature over in the desert and how it is affecting us.
So this is the chart and showing the distribution of origin.
So 1 to 3 as we have three values in the origin variable.
And first is one of those two and three and the frequency that we are getting as on Y-axis,
the bottom of all shows the distribution of the origin variable, the desert, and it appears that the clean
values out there and the name one followed by Origin three and Origin two.
So Origin has higher frequency then Origin three, and then after Origin two.
Let's explore how the origin affects other feature in the basic by summarizing some key
statistic for numerical variables and how we understand that
there is a complete explanation, We come back to this code. So now here you can see
we have applied the mean function and we actually want to know how this variable is impacting.
Okay, what is importance on other variables? So empty originally has highest
value fuel, but efficiency. So mpg.
So all region three has the highest mean value followed by origin do and origin one
So highest will be origin three So this did the cars which are from the origin three
identity more fuel efficient. If the cars are from origin do so they are competitive
with origin three less efficient and the origin one has the least bit.
So no gods which are from the origin one comparatively with origin three
and do has less fuel efficient cars. Okay, so next is cylinder displacement and horsepower.
So cars origin one have higher range value and the other one is gone
from Origin doing three house majority whip fuel cylinder and lower horsepower. That's how this origin is important
for understanding the other features based on different, different origin.
We have different different values of each column and that we are getting
through this summary. So how we are getting this summary by this code when we apply this quote
grew by origin do not mean function. Mean function will be the mean value of origin and column.
The other column columns Here you can see MP of origin one is 26.2,
so the highest value of mpg is for three.
Then after two and then after one we have already discussed what does it mean? Let's copy
this code from here and apply it. And this check that whether we are getting output,
yes, we are getting the correct output, what we are getting through GPP and that's how we can understand
what that the distribution of the origin very well and how this
variable affect the other features in the dataset and the importance of this variable.
So now we're going to understand whether do we have missing values in the visit or not.
Car-MPG - Handling Missing Values
So for that, for us, we ask you by using this from that in Dubai and handle any missing values
in the current data, and how did you choose to handle them and why? Let's see what output we get over here.
So We are getting an output. I want to know what code that we display over here for that.
If we have missing values.
Okay, so now let's understand this backwards.
To handle missing values, we first need to identify it whether they are from the desert or not.
Once we have found them, we can decide on an appropriate method to handle them
based on the context of the data. If we can remove those missing values and if we do not impact the whole dataset
because of removing the values from the data, if it is not impacting the dataset,
then we can remove. But if we remove the missing values related and inspect the dataset,
then there we have to use some process that is called imputing the missing values.
And that can be done by using some relevant code. But here first is what common strategies
we have for this type of is removing rules that I already discussed
the deleting rows with missing values. If they are few in number and if they are not impacting,
it's only remove the values. If they are not impacting the main dataset then we can do
feeling with mean and media. It's really missing values with the mean or median
value of the columns suitable for convenience that even next is feeling with more feeling.
Missing values denote most frequent value of. The column suitable for categorical variable
using interpolation interpolating values based on surrounding data stable four times use in order data.
So basically what we do is missing values at the end, and if we do not want to remove those rules
which contain the missing values, so we'll impute those missing values with the mean median on more value
and then we can it for them here. Let's understand whether do we have
the using their lives in our dataset, but not for that. We have a goal over here missing values
some the equal to current be the reason that is null is domain function.
We check whether do we have any missing values or not. So if we have
five missing values in one column, so that will get sum up by using some function.
And the final total number of values for a particular column will get displayed as an output
that will store in this variable which we have created over here. And when we call this that it would make the final output.
This is the mean based on that what you do showing over here as a reason it is zero means
we do not have any missing values in the columns. It appears that there are no missing
values in the got embedded as indicated by this one label. However, we previously notice
that hotspot that is XP column has an object type which might indicate
some irregularities in the data sets as non-EU countries. So let's investigate this column to see
there are any unusual values that need to be handled. So we have already discussed about this column
that that column is of of dictator type. This column warns that we have to check that
whether this column has a missing value or not, it's this column has a missing value.
So we have to work on it. The quote related with this is this one C and
if in the object type, any missing values is there. So value in build those values.
So here as an output, we are getting the question mark is that particular rule doesn't have
Car-MPG - Regression Modeling
features having more impact on the target value. But so here if you can see the cool
feature importance, we did or did nothing. We are giving feature and coefficient values.
One column would be of a feature and another would be off coefficient. This coefficient
by seeing this value will weaken and this then okay, this feature has the highest impact and this feature
is actually influencing our target. Even more. So out of all these we can see that the people about
using the quality of each feature in the mitigation modeling, reflecting their influence on fuel
that is MP z column. So car type is the most influential feature over here
with a positive coefficient fy22 which indicate that the car with the higher
value associated with high fuel efficiency. So this value is somewhere
influencing this empty variable more then after comes 1.49
acquisition that is of cylinder and then all region and the least is
viewed as more negative influence indicating that heavy car tanks to have slightly more fuel efficiency.
So this has been negative influence. So why we want to check the importance of features
because we should understand that this feature has high impact on the target variable.
And the conclusion over here is the feature car types in a no region in any, you seem to have
the most significant influence on the fuel efficiency and reason we can look,
and the interpretation of this coefficient should be done with caution as the nature of the variable for the engine will be good.
Any other factor can affect the coefficients. So this is the final analysis
that features in our dataset how they are impacting the main target variable.
And this is the way we can analyze the data and the last step we are going to perform now
we're going to apply this code. Also, we could check whether we are getting the correct output or not.
When I enter this output, what we are getting here instead DVD.
We are getting heated also so that so you can analyze your data or whatever you want to analyze,
you can easily do that by using DVD. It's so easy to understand
because you are getting the code also. And you can see that I was barely applying
the same code indicator and I was getting the correct output there also. So it's very easy to understand.
And with that it's very easy to get the complete explanation.
Also, if suppose I'm very few stick that what is the meaning of particular function or the particular code
that also you can easily understand using DVD. So you actually make your redundancy process
easy and very understandable. So that's how we can analyze that be done
using Gen Z. Finally, you can apply code what you are getting through the DVD in
and then look like a on to be done just to check whether you are getting the correct answers or not.
And one thing I can add over here is we should play around with the DVD, like
we can explore more. Also here, these are the steps of data analysis using Python.
And if you want to know more concept based on the output, what we are getting that
also you can explore by asking or by applying or by adding prompts
in the DVD that makes your data analysis journey more easy.
So yeah, this is all about how to analyze the data using python. Good to check.
Did we? Thank you. So now as we were continuously discussing
Car-MPG - Summary Statistics
missing values, how to embed missing values with media and we often see with all of you should even be give more.

I mean what is all about the mean median? What is these values?
So we understand this by using this problem, we get to know. So the problem, which I'm going to add
is display the python for some of the statistic for the numerical variables in the column.
We the dataset unit of performance. What insight can you gain from the statistic? So let's see what this statistic is here
as we are getting the output
so we can use describe method in PANDAS to obtain some of these statistics
for the numerical value when in the current dataset, this matter will provide us
with the count mean standard deviation minimum 20 quartile median
70 the squad and the dispute three and maximum for each numerical variable. I know it's bit confusing for you, but
we'll these all down. So step by step here we are getting the code
to get this summary statistic. What do we not know? What is basically statistic is so that we ask first
to the GDP and then we'll come back to this slide. We are getting the complete output
based on the prompt, which we do with it. But let's understand first
what somebody statistic is. So we'll ask
said if we do that, explain. This. Summary
statistic.
Okay. So now let's will understand all the terms. What I was
saying here, the mean median will standard deviation and not somebody strategy
will understand this part and then we go back to that. Good. So here are some statistics
provided, concise description of the mean aspect of the dataset,
particularly for numerical variables, obviously, because if you want to check the mean of the column,
it should be on numeric value, then only will get the mean median or more. So this help in understanding
the distribution central tendency and dispersion of the beta. So to have you done so
well in this end this first what is central tendency but a discussion on the beta,
what next we are getting well let's see that goes so the commonly used summary
statistics are out which will go on what the total number of non null observations in the dataset.
It has an understanding the size of the dataset and identifying any missing methods
mean the automatic average median is the minimum value that is specified
the higher half from the lower half of the dataset non.
The next is a standard deviation, a measure of the dispersion or spread of the values. A high standard
deviation indicate greater variability, while a low standard
deviation indicates that the values are closer to the minimum. The smallest value in the dataset
maximum, the largest value of the dataset. Because I basically will show you for each column
now the person died. This was a divide into three parts 25th, 50 and 75.
50 is basically what this one, the 25th person died.
That is. Q One is the value below which 25% of the observations fun
and so it wasn't possible that is skew in which the value below
which 25% of the observation fall and in between we checked the median value that is 50%.
So now the range is the next one. The difference between the maximum and the minimum value
that is called an idea of the spread of the deadly called the B days.
Right next is interquartile range that is IQ. It is also a difference.
So what is this basically the difference between 75th and 2050, the personal values
representing the range within which median that is 50% of the value false.
It is it all was median of a spread that is non affected by outliers. Next is more the value that appears
most frequently not be beside these more median. We've already studied in mathematics.
See meaning is over here also next is variance. Variance is the average of this
Why difference from the mean is another major of displeasure with the high value indicate greater value.
Maybe variance means what that you can ask if you still use.
So you can simply just ask explain
in detail. So we view over here as a from the next thing. That is indeed when I enter this,
you really get what that is. The statistical median, the describe the spread of a set of data
point is in the dataset. It quantify how far individual number in the dataset are from the average and thus provide
insight into the overall variability of the data. So how we calculate that,
another thing, but here basically we'll get all these values in the somebody statistic.
So now let's go back to the code and here we are getting the output,
we are getting the output for each column. We are getting count, we are getting mean is basically the sum
means total value. Basically here count is what misunderstandings
what said to be issuing the total number of non null observation then be present.
So now here we have count means standard deviation 25%, 50%, 75 that is Q one
and 75 is complete max value, minimum value. And so. Right, so let's understand
this particular code then that is giving good account would indicate a normal or not.
Then I enter this your I'm getting the complete sum.
This is the complete something that is a complete statistic of our dataset. It is showing the minimum value.
Minimum or maximum value mean that is average standard deviation. Look how the data is deviated.
So these are the statistics. Next is why we always check this.
As you know that we have one column over here that is actually. So then we were checking
the missing values. We found that this column has some missing values and we cannot remove those rules
because will impact the dataset if we remove. So what we did there, we imputed with
median right? So by seeing this statistic,
we can come to the conclusion that which value we can imbue those missing numbers.
So there we build in the missing values with median, we can build with average value.
That is mean. Also, our median is very now, as of now,
we have discussed the statistical summary of the business check. Now let's understand the next step
which comes under be dummies. This is the summary statistic. Now we check what output we are getting
here in terms of explanation. So first column is empty ranges from 9 to 46.6 empty.
The average fuel efficiencies around this that is mean value standard deviation is 7.8
indicating the variability in the data set seem there might be some high fuel efficient cars
and the maximum value of this particular column is 46.6
C we are getting the interpretations based on the other columns
that is still unknown. Basically, cement horsepower weight acceleration is.
So now here is origin. Also we have, which is a very important column and we have horsepower
is also an important column. So we can see that we are getting fair enough outcome based on the wrong
which we will have given over here for D and we are getting the correct output
because we want to determine dividend. So let's understand the next step
that comes under data analysis. Thank you so will understand how
Car-MPG - Univariate Analysis and Correlation Matrix
all the variables are correlated with each other by using collision matrix.
So when I give this probe that create a collision, my guess what do you do that will show you the relationship
between all the variables? Because that also we have to understand when will we increase one variable
that what is the impact on other variables? How the owner collided with each other.
When I do this prompt, let's see what we are getting here.
So here for this collision matrix, provide a numerical summary of the linear relationship between zero very loose
correlation causation that range from -1 to 1 minus one, indicating a negative linear
relationship, one indicating a positive positive. Basically. Then we are getting the
graph in upward direction. That means that is positive linear relationship.
Negative means that because of one other values is getting decreased zero indicating that
there is no relationship between variables. So then the goal over here to get the collision
rate, there is a function which we have to apply the dataset. The function name is over.
Here is C audible at the discourse function, which will you the complete summary
which would give you the complete somebody. A lot of how all the variables are
related with each of the and you can see that we are getting over here.
The result and the result is that first MP Z and this these are related
is .57 negative basically with easily these values getting this.
So let's understand this complete statistic what it is somebody are getting here
through JWT and big and it didn't get a stick so here you can see this is the complete relationship
and let's understand step by step ambient cylinder, strong negative correlation,
which means that MPD and the cylinder variables are negatively correlated. More Zealanders
associate with low fuel efficiency and PD and displacement strong again, negative correlation,
which means large value of displacement leads to lower fuel efficiency and
and horsepower. Again, the strong negative correlation, which means high value of at B column
associated with the low value of MPD, that is fuel efficiency. So when we compare MPD and read strong
negative correlation, heavy car tends to have low fuel efficiency means the V8 of a car.
If it is high, if it is more so that we then do
low fuel efficiency, So the value we do will decrease the desire here.
The collision is strongly negative. Next is cylinder displacement,
horsepower and lead. These very lose is strongly positive correlated with each other
because of one variable. Other variable is getting increased. So more cylinders typically means
larger displacement will be high horsepower and greater weight
acceleration and other variables. Negative correlation exclusion and empty
has positive correlation. Cars with faster acceleration tends to be more fuel efficient.
Then after e in empty Madrid positive correlation because you can see the values
point fighting. So these all are text based analysis. What if we want to see this to a chart
like how to visualize this collision metric through chart? So let's ask the Jedi smooth
like how to visualize this collision matrix and how we are going to ask this.
So now if you want to visualize summary statistic, which is coming in the form of
four numbers, if I want to visualize using a chart, I don't know the chart I should use over here
to visualize the whole D dots. So I said divided self that visualize the output of collision metrics
using an appropriate check. Let's see what outcome we'll get to here.
So for visualizing the correlation matrix
heat map is the best chart and it's the best way to visualize.
So here you can see that heat map is an excellent way to visualize correlation matrix
as it allows us to quickly identify the strength and the direction of the relationship, whether it is negative
or positive correlation and whether it is in the air or not, so that we can easily understand
and the stronger correlation will have more intense color with positive correlation.
Typically shown in one good example, the air is blue and negative correlation in another.
So let's see what output we get over here. So this is the good
to generate the heat map and this is the output based on that goal. So you can see that
this is the final correlation matrix using heat map,
the heat map about visualizing the correlation matrix for the Guard and big disconnect providing,
this understanding of the relationship between all the variables. And you can see that if I compare this
handler and guard, they negative correlation, if I compare cylinder variable
or let's say MVC. So if I compare MPEG variable with cylinder, again it is a negative correlation
and let's see which one is the positive one. So the positive one is,
this one origin and gardening, it is positively correlated
and if the color code is dark that means we are highly correlated,
either negative or positive. If the color code is a light. So they are
correlated, but not strongly correlated. So here you can see that the ATP and this this.
So here it is related how it is correlated point 99. So there is a high correlation so that so
we can understand the collision matrix we can visualize correlation metrics using heat map.
So this is one we will visualize correlation matrix. Next, apply this. Cool, let's understand this code when we
based this in Jupyter notebook and we'll see whether we get and correct or not.
So when I copied this over here, I learned to see that
they were getting down. What do they getting another equation that looks okay.
So here it's showing an additive, right? Because we are calling here directly the variable correlation matrix.
So we are giving us a variable over here equation which variable you want to display the heatmap
and I'm giving you a correlation matrix collision matrix computer here.
The movie is not getting any variable with the name correlation matrix.
So first we have to check the previous code. Here you can see that
we have stored all the correlation. Some we it statistic in this meeting
with which you are not defining in the notebook. So this will not get an output. So first I will copy this quote and copy
and over here then we should get an output.
Let's see. So here first by using this correlation function
that you see, all the blood will be stored. The complete statistical correlation
matrix in this variable, and then we call this variable
in heatmap. So we'll get the
complete chart based on the coordination matrix of our dataset.
So this is the complete output. What are getting over here and that means the code, what subject it is generating is giving the correct output.
Now the next step is to perform the univariate analysis
here. We have seen that the how all the variables correlated, how
they are related with each other. Is there any relationship? If it is there, then how the relationship is
and what type of relationship negative positive so that we have already discussed. Next is to understand
the analysis between all the variables univariate in this and bivariate
analysis are going to understand. First we cover the univariate and that this is not the next prompt.
What here is what is unibody design since first we like this and what is basically value added analysis.
I know what is univariate, but if a learner is analyzing the dataset for the first time,
the person should know what is univariate analysis. So first tell us go
that what is univariate analysis and then provide for the amount we tested
that analysis and visualize using appropriate standard instrument and understand
the output. Okay.
So you divided analysis is basically one union means one. So is a type of statistical analysis
focus on single variable. So if you want to analyze
all the variables that is comes under univariate,
if you want to understand the relationship between two variables together, that comes into my
to minus two. So univariate basically, if you want to understand all, if you want to visualize
a single variable. So we use various plots for that.
And here you can see for this dataset for any other dataset. Also we can conduct
the univariate analyzes first should be on numerical variable and visualize that using histogram box,
plot or density plot histogram provide a frequency distribution of the data,
how the data is distributed because in terms frequency, we are going to visualize
showing the sheep how the data is spread and the time presented. See next days box plot
which will offer a visual summary of the central tendency and how the data is
spread, whether it is normally distributed or it is left skewed or right.
So that I'll discuss. And as we as the potential of and then we have an outlier
in the variable or not, that also we can envision using box block the density plot is
is in another way to perform an event analysis. So let's see here.
This is the complete code. Based on that we get an output univariate analysis of all the details.
So here we are getting, we are visualizing to be done, we are visualizing the variables
using histogram. So if I we see this score, you can see here
that the showing this all the numerical variables because if we want to analyze
the variable positive j call in numerical variables do we have in the dataset will result and based on that
we going to use over here for blue and the blue will actually
repeat this code again and again to get the final output, which should be based on histogram,
because here what we are giving that looping through numerically was to create histogram, box block
and density. So basically we are going to visualize. So all these modes. Lots.
This is the complete code for that. Let's see the output. This is histogram showing you
the values are normally distributed or not. So let's see the explanation based on this
jobs First is let's discuss Nbg MPG appears to have a
riotously distribution with most cars having fuel efficiency around 15 to 25 empty.
So let's go to this histogram. So here you can see that
this right is skewed the plane is going towards. Right? So that slide though name is right is skewed
and most of the distribution is towards right. And with most cars having good fuel efficiency,
how much between 20 to 25 from here. So if I'm going to divide
so most of between 2025 to you having fuel efficiency 45 also you having
then also what most of the fuel efficiency and because I'm sending 20 to 25
next is same four cylinder displacement. Let's discuss about this origin.
This is a categorical very light showing the distribution of cars across different bodies. You got a binary very much
when the of condition got in degrees. Now let's discuss one more variable over here to understand this histogram
and the right is skewed. Okay, let's just because it was horsepower so right the skewed distribution
indicating that most car had but in the lower range. So there is that horsepower the variable
that is actually here so you can see that they were here
is really skewed and they are showing that that most here most
values comps ended in lower range, lower end, basically
50 to 75. And this is the lowering because the higher values in agonists.
But this slide is good. So yeah, this is the way to visualize the dataset using histogram.
This they usually provide valuable insight into they knew the characteristic of the where it wasn't is that shape of the distribution,
whether the values are normally distributed or not. So now next is we're
going to visualize the dataset that using box plot as well as we have already visualized using histogram.
Second will be box block. So here why we are using Box to understand
whether we have any outliers in the dataset or not. For that I've given the wrong
that visualized about it as of using box load and reason that we are getting this output, that box
not also known as box and whisker block is an action. We actually do
visualize the distribution of numerical very well as we provide information about central tendency split and potential outliers.
So you can see here this is the code relevant goal. And based on that we are getting the output
so few of the variables have some outliers, which is a here these the dots. Right.
These are not what outliers values which are completely different. Not different, but the if we see that
is the completely outlier from the mean no values. I wanted to explain how different or
from mean values. Like if we give in a column six values like two, four, six
then and the last it would be for an example hundred. So that hundred comes into place.
Okay, so it's breaking of that sequence, right? So here all values are very nearby.
They do, of course, exceed what the time is, completely very far from the sequence of that CD.
So that is a part of outlier here. We can see that this
column has outliers and the explanation. This column also has outliers.
So let's see, the final reason, the summary of this, the busy MPG displays
right skew distribution me some potential outliers on the higher and higher end views here
after 50% basically now in the portion of 75th quarter. So now the next is cylinder shows
distinct categories reflecting the specific engine configuration we were discussing in the box
load about each trade reveals, a writer's guild disillusion with a few outliers on the higher and higher and lower end
is what 20 to quality is lower and that was 70 50% that is 75%.
That duty is still higher. So in height and we have outliers here on.
So here we have in lower end is then so this is the box not through which we can understand
which variables have outliers. And if we have more, get to that to work on that instance.
So this is all about to visualize the variables using box plot and also comes in univariate analysis.
So this is the box plot we have already discussed. Now let's apply this code of this box flawed
and the histogram and let's see whether we are getting the output into the notebook. So when I copied code from here,
let's be over here. And then before
I'll be getting the output. Yes, you're getting all the history on these and all the variables here we already discussed.
And the next let's apply the code to generate the box plot.
So simply we have to copy the code and we have based
in the notebook. So here we are getting the complete box load. And you can see
these are the organized outlets higher than the other one. So we have outliers in this variable.
So this is the box plot. Now we will going do understand about bivariate analysis
and we're going to use a prompt to generate
bivariate analysis for how to visualize the relationship between.
Two variables using various plots we want to understand that to do now
we have understood how to analyze without using Python code to NYPD.
Now we're going to understand the dynamics is using in command to do activity. So first, we need to understand already
Data Analysis using Excel - Overview
various steps to perform to be done, and this is using action. So when I do this prompt over here,
I'm getting the explanation based on that means I get various
that need to be covered during analysis by using exit.
So collect data, import data. So how we collect data, we will be done in the form of X
and if you will want to import that for us, you have to open X and then we have to copy
all we can directly open the file or actually you see form it and we use that completely.
That's it for the analysis. Next step is cleaning and preprocessing can be missing if we have data.
Formatting and formatting means forward sense properly to ensure consistency.
Remove duplicates. We have discussed this part when we were discussing using python could
remove or duplicates is actually very important, but convert text to columns
if needed. So is this. If you need to convert the transformation,
it is required there. So there we have to convert the next to column
no data acceleration in summarization. So we are using certain
specific segments of data. We would able to create a table way to summarize and aggregate data
across different dimensions. Calculate descriptive statistic statistic we have already discussed
like if you want to know the average median and standard deviation and signal to calculate the summary statistic,
this visualization using different jobs, we can do that and analysis and modeling
to apply formulas and function for that. We are going to do that. Then, after analysis and modeling and interpretation
and insight generation today we're going to analyze the data using Excel. Let's understand
data analysis, using actually combining step by step. So these are the steps which we've already covered
when we were discussing the BE and its needs using Python.
So the first prompt for analyzing the data using actually command is indexing
command for the amount dataset. We have already loaded the data so that the actual command
for the bundle. That said, we check the database because obviously if it is the stopping process of data analysis,
we have to check the types of the data which we will do use for that analysis.
Then I do this. Let's see what explanation here,
what output we are getting. So next thing you cannot directly technically today
we have to apply some formula to check that. So we have to select the say
for which you want to check the beat. So however you can use various methods
which matter. Let's disclose that. Use a number format dropdown menu. Select the cell column you want to inspect.
Look at the number of all the dropdown menu on the then select from it excel, function it in for later types.
So we're going to use this formula. How we are going to use.
We are going to understand which data type we want to check support
if you want to take the column has a numeric all in the column is having next to do or
the column has date type of values. So for that we have three functions.
So to that we can check if the value is numeric, then what we get,
let's see, we want to apply the same function we apply the same formula that in exit
one more we use inspect form and manually right click on the cell or column, select form itself
and look at the number that. The Excel. Also, you can do even more is that we're going to apply this one.
Let's apply this here. E One is what the reference for the cell you want to check.
So I want to check whether the column has numeric value or not. If it is not numeric, then what would we get This?
So I'll go to the exit sheet and apply here. This formula.
So I'll change this value. I want to check for which column
this one you. Let's take the 3399. We have the values you.
So when I select the range over here, I would see you can see that from E2.
That means column eight, rule number two, then 839, then column E 3399.
So when I'm applying this range, I will check whether from column E
to 1899 is number or is not a number
is not a numeric value. So when I enter this
so it's showing here. True. So when I enter after giving the range in that formula, I'm getting true.
That means the values which comes under first column that is empty
is numeric value that so you can check the be and if you want to check
for other column, you just have to select the range from there to there. You want to check the beat
that so you can check other processes. Are there other procedures mean so other ways are there
to check the data type. I want you to explore these steps. I have applied one way
you can apply ways as well to get the data type of each column.
Now the next prompt, what are going to apply here is
like the Excel command. Do check the missing values for the about dataset. So this is the next step prompt.
And based on that, we're going to understand whether do we have missing values or not. So when I enter this prompt,
I will get the required formula and based on that, we can check whether do we have
missing values in our columns. If we have missing value, then we'll imbue those values or we can remove based on the dataset.
So here we have a lot of these. So first is we can check by using this
blank function. Next is conditional formatting. How do we say using filter to identify
blanks in buckets? Some members that will not remain blank, Some values would be there, but
they could be like unknown or something similar like question mark. Right? So that is not a blank set values then.
So this process will not be so helpful. We'll find out the missing values
using copy with table. To summarize, missing values using the if function with is blank for custom messages.
So let's supply the first one to this live and I have no let's see like this from here.
Let's go to the text sheet play here this formula.
So as I applied over here, the formula is blank and I'm selecting some rows
from the first column eight 3 to 825. I'm selecting
as if now you can see that 8825 when I enter, I'm getting false.
So basically false is showing over here that we do not have any blank cell over here.
What if we have missing value in terms of question that question what will comes under what
the unknown value, which is not giving any of what to the required column
so that also contain the missing values, then we cannot get the exact output
through this particular form. Yes. So what we can do in that is what I will do here.
We can apply one more real easy to do that is conditional formatting.
One more is using filter so that we can
apply index in cheat for each column. Suppose if I want to check in
this column, okay, I want to apply the food where I will go
and go to this data. Here. I'm getting this building option
and applied filter because I have selected one column over here. So on that I'm getting this within one.
I didn't click on this at all. I'm getting all the unique values. So here you can see
one value is question one, right? So this value is completely unknown
to us. All values are numeric, except this question in question mark is considered a missing value only.
So what we can do, we will filter out this value. How many rows do we have in our dataset
with this step of that equals? So I will select what for style this select
all the values and then select only this one
click on. Okay. So out of 399 rules,
we have one, two, three, four, five. We have our rules here.
You can see six of those. Okay, That has this question mark.
Correct. So basically, these all are missing. That is, we look, we have to build this missing value.
How we can do that. So we can do that by I'm building these question mark with
median average all mode of this particular column. So for that what I can do,
I can just do one more. Well, we first we need to understand
why we are including with average mean on median. So here if the value is giving importance
and if we remove that missing value will not impact the dataset, then we can remove the review values.
But if the values what we have in the next zone, then it'll give the importance
focus on what is actually impacting the dataset. So there we should impute those missing values with average mean
and that we want to discuss then while discussing the data analysis using Python.
So here we need to import those six rules with that question character
we do average and more value. If you want to check the average
next in field here with me. So what I can do here, I will select this column.
You can see here some we are getting average. We are getting 1049.
So the average value of this particular column, if I select this whole column
zero, so I'm getting the average value 104.469 or one more ways, then we can apply what
the formula equal average formula. We can apply this this select the say
here. If I select equal to average
or we can select median also. So if I select median
median a lot. So we have to give the range over here. So I'll select the range from there from here to the 99.
So the column is D from the to the 399.
So B2 column, D3 99.
I want the median value. Then I enter I'm going to 93.5
so we can even build those missing with this median value. Okay, how do you know?
So I will select this first column. Okay. Well, let's discuss this first with 20 do
How to Build Missing Values. So when I go back to the sensitivity
here, I'm getting like how to get the missing value. Now I will understand how to build the missing values
if we have in the dataset. So when I enter this, we will get some editions from
said party. So do Jedi credibility. I'm getting here some situations that here's our common approach
which we can use. Calculate the mean of the column we have already calculated mean we will imbue the value
nor by using mean we will imputed median. So instead of applying average function,
we can apply median function there and then often we can replace the original column
with debut bit. How we can do that. These all are the different ways to improve the values.
If you want to replace the original value column, then to their value you can just copy columns and paste it as values in the column.
E control. Let's see select column, right click interest based, special and value.
So now we're going to compute the value with the median. As we know, the median values, 93.5. We some missing values.
We have in this actually column, you select this whole column, they filter the values.
And here we will select all the values only will select the question mark that it divorced
and we are having here. That was three Lewis with question. What we will do
and viewed is how we're going to compute this will select this list. We can do it to you and you can see fine
what replace it what so the replace with 93.5 find this question mark rules and replace this
with a median value and then click on replace all you can see that all values got replaced with 93.5
and that's how we get in the missing values so that so we can view the missing values
if you have in your data. Thank you. Now we're going to understand if any columns are in the incorrect format.
Car-MPG - Converting Data Types in Excel
So how we can convert the type of that value,
how to convert to other by using actually commands. So I'm leaving here.
Is it wrong that right next to command to convert if any columns are in the incorrect format,
convert them to the appropriate type for the above? Because it when I enter this prompt,
let's see what output we are getting over here. Indexing you can convert data type using various methods
here we are getting multiple ways to convert the data type and we will going to apply one
the other ways. You can apply later. First, these converting text to number.
If a column has no numbers, but the data type of that column is text.
So we're going to convert that column in to number. So how to do that?
So select the cell column and which containing the text you want to convert and go to data
that went context to column. That's how we can do for a lot of these are you choosing delimited
or fixed with as needed and select appropriately. For me, one way is converting them. What is this text?
Another way is how to convert date statistics. So this is the way to convert date,
which is stored as a fixed sending number for converting text to properties. Uppercase lowercase.
These are the ways to convert those values into the respective beta states.
Now we're going to perform for an example. If want to convert text to number, how I can do that.
So I have to select the cell or column which containing the text that you want to convert
after go to the data. So let's let's select this. What an example. If I select, I want to convert the value.
Here is 130 for an example. Let's see if I give here,
not one that B I'm giving here and this is text. Now, if I want to convert this value
with the data type number, how to do that. So plus time select this next step would be good
to detect them and click on next column. So when I go to detect that is rated that
and then after what you have to select next to column here you have to select what this
that this command or next up and each will do it feeds online online column with the specific
you need to know what is this way check the last step follow view
that choosing delimited off execute as needed and select the appropriate for me. So I will still appear
for an example delimited. So whenever I select this
after this in which one
would you want to select generate need If you want to open would indeed the which way
you want to convert this there so you can select and for an example I want to convert to
index is already index. It is in the numerical numeric and is not text over here.
This annual over here is what numerical okay. It is in the form of envisat, either integer or floor.
So how we can convert. So first clicks next and then finish.
So this particular value will get changed to other database. This will be next data. They
contain this value for now. We want. The.
So now after discussing about how to convert a type, as of now
it is not required to not as NIC so will not go in deep. But here the next round
which we really need to check, is that to calculate basic statistic on the dataset
what we have already showed here. So we'll going to ask did deputy and I didn't actually on
to calculate the basic statistic for the about dataset. When I enter this prompt,
let's see what output we are getting. So now in
actually you can see the output. What you are getting here is you can calculate basic statistic that does mean median,
which we already discussed, like what is somebody statistic and what the summary statistic covers.
Basically it covers mean median standard deviation minimum and maximum value using building function here.
So how we can apply these function, we have something with function in X in which we can apply directly and
we can get these values like median standard deviation mode. Okay, So first
let's see how to get the output based on this function. So here,
if I use this formula, what is this to get the mean value that means to get the
average of each column. So for an example, if I want to know the average.
So what I can do here and just apply the formula here equals to
average automatically you will get the name from dropdown as you just select this and
the formula is asking you the range from there to where you want the mean.
Suppose if I want to select for empty column the average value, they want to know of this first column
that is empty. What I will do here I will select the beat. So from there I want to select from 8 to 8 column
second row below 99 as we have 399 goes for this dataset, so I will select column second row
from E to do E 99. So I'll give it equals after that value column and E 399
I'll close this parenthesis and when I enter here I'm getting the mean is 23.49.
This is the meat of this first column. That's how you can take the average. That means the mean of other column.
So now we're going to understand the median. So how are we going to do that? We're going to apply instead of average
median. So equal to median, then you will type median automatically. You are getting this name
in the dropdown this and you just double click on that. Again, you have to give the rate
from there to where you want the median value. I want now, this time median for this
column that this cylinder will get. So I will select the range. That means the cylinder column of B
column and the one the range from B to will be C 99. So the column
will be 399. I did see 19 into the guilty 99 rule.
I want a median value. So vintage and so I'm getting here the median of
B two to be D 99 is four. So that's how we can calculate the
and other statistics as well as we have a standard deviation for that,
you only have to apply what equal to standard deviation. The problem is and study easy.
That is standard deviation. We have to select the range from there to where you want the standard deviation. Obviously, for each column
you have to select all the values for the dataset because we are not analyzing few rows
and columns, we are analyzing the whole industry. You have to select all values from the console.
You can select minimum value also how which one is the minimum? Let's select this formula here.
I will apply this for one column in max sheet.
It's like this
minimum. Now here I will change the rate. I want to check the minimum value
of this column origin. So Origin has a column edge and the front edge to edge.
399 I want to check the minimum value in this column to add to this
at 399 and I and do the minimum values one
why I showed this because here we can easily see that we only have three origin rate,
which we have already discussed when we were analyzing the data using Python. So here you can see that
we have three values. One, two, three, one, two, three. One is the minimum benefiting from here. It's very difficult to find that
the minimum value, what we are getting is correct or not. But here we know that in origin we have only three values
one, two, three, and then we are applying min function. We are getting one. That means we are getting the correct output over here.
So that's how we can get the final outcome based on the different different formulas
which is used for statistical summary. Now the next step is how
Car-MPG - Univariate Analysis in Excel
to perform the divided analysis using exit and how to create jobs for visualization of demo data.
So the next step from what I am giving here is like combining Excel to perform analysis
and how to create charts for region. I feel about it and I will handle this. Let's see what output
we are getting here. So univariate analysis is basically what if you want to visualize single network
at the time? So there we put something that if want to perform or if you want to check the relationship
between two variables, then there we will perform biometric analysis. So here to, perform univariate analysis.
We will use the various methods. We can use Instagram, we can use box plot,
we can use flight chart, histogram, a common weight. We know the distribution of variable,
how the variable is distributed, and the box load is to check the median
and to check whether do we have outliers or not. So that's all we can do.
So here we are getting different ways to visualize the data
visualization using charts. If you want to perform any better than Alice's means, if you want to analyze angle very well.
So one which is using histogram for that, if you select the data which you want to analyze
and then go to insert that instead of statistic chart and just histogram, then I go to X and cheat.
I select, you know what it is origin values from ET to be at a default adjective.
Now I go to insert there, I'll click on recommended Judge
all chart. I want to select histogram. So manage histogram.
I'm getting over here the output so that so my output is
this one is one then two and this one is 50. That's how you can check
which one has the higher the value sees one how many value it is.
59. Okay, so we are getting the frequency
which is distributed in this column. So 59 values of one and this one is
will see this 1.2 values, two has 14 values. So that's all you can
visualize the column using histogram. So now next what I am going to visualize,
I'm going to visualize the other column, but using box plot.
So if I want to use box, not only the process is see, you only have to select the values
for which you want to visualize to box not going. So that go to the recommended chart,
click on all jobs and select which one you want to select. Define an example. Here is a box and then name this box.
And the not only. So when I select box and we start not here,
I'm getting the box, but for the values
which are selected over here. So that's how you can select the box, not even you can visualize the difference.
Now, the next part is Python also finds out how to visualize the data
using by just saying this. I want you all to explore this. I applied the same way as I applied for
visualizing the data using histogram and box. Not seeing that you have to go to insert tab.
They have to select the recommended chart and click on all charts and select up by done options
before you have to select the data for which you want to visualize through through stock.
So this is the way we analyze the single variables variables.
I'll find it using different different dogs, which comes under univariate analysis.
Thank you. Now let's see how you can supercharge your productivity

Generating Excel Functions using ChatGPT
Okay, so now. What if we want to calculate the average of, let's say, column number D,
that is quarterly revenue? What if I want What is the average of it? And considering that I am a layman
and I don't know how to use Excel, how would I do that in a short the way rates are just So what will I do?
I'll just go to charge Chad's CBT and I'll write in the prompt. Right. So now I just check in the data set.
So if it is column number D right? B due to let's say D 28,
I need the average of it. Right? So I just mentioned the raw numbers as. D2
to be 28. So I'll write this so.
So do you give me what, what needs to be done to write. So the function that is used
is equal to average. Now I'll just simply click on this cell right here and based in that formula and the syntax
and it just gives me IDs and it automatically selects the range, right? So if I give them starting in the end,
it is just direct. You do that, right? So that's, that's how Chargeability can enhance the way you're
working on Excel, right? You make life much more easier. Right?
So here it gives me 54,000 619 is the average revenue of quarter
three combining all the companies right here, right. So if I want to do it the other way,
if I just want like to give me the the average. Of of the.
Same company all the four quarters, what would that how would that go. We would just have to mention them. Okay.
If it is the same row then it would be do. See, do. D do it do
if I'm considering the first company. Right. Right. So that can also be done. Now what do I have to do
is that I need to calculate how many times is like let's see where the total number of movies
in English, French and Italian. Right? How would I do that? Right. So if I know, okay,
if there are four languages right here or five languages or how many languages, I want to segregate, I want to find
how many are how many are letting list movies are there, how many French movies,
how many Italian movies? How would I do that? Okay, so this type in the prompt. That
how to calculate the total number of times.
Oh, would has been repeated in oh
well again. Right.
Oh syntax for the thing
you C right.
So it tells me that the, the, the function that I am going to use is count. Right.
So in the previous module I talked about a generalized bit of key functions that that important.
I talked about counting, afraid to count the number of times that a certain thing has come up right.
So the same thing is what is mentioned or what head is just that
I gave you that reference so that you would have an idea of it if I a man, if I was just starting out,
I definitely would not know what count defense Now in a very simplest of the terms, what I did, I just added a prompt
to ask DPD the computer how to calculate the total number of times a word has been repeated in a column.
Write this index for the same right. This is basically handling. Okay, This is the problem that I'm fixing. Find a solution.
That's your job because this is like any assistant will help you in whatever ways
that you would want trade. So it gets given me example of how to do that. Right. So I'll just just copy this right here.
It has given me an option, so I just let's just put it over here right?
So it will give me zero because nothing is there. So I just edited it out the range at eight. Now I'll just remove that in section
and just type. I just drag and drop all this entire range from B to to be 22. Right.
Then what are the criteria I'm looking for the, for English. I'm looking for English. Right. So I'll. Read
English. English. Right. So this print and enter. Right.
So now it has given me the exact number of ground that English is repeated in column B, Right.
So if you want to check it, if you want a cross-check, one, two. Three.
Four and five. So that's accurate. So similarly, if I have to find how many times
the word French has repeated in column B, how would I do that? I'll just copy the scene syntax
that Chargeability provided me is the range from B,
from A to B, then E 22, B, 20.
Two rate 22. Right then boom, dinging apple.
To French rate. And then I press ended. So now the French has also been repeated
five times. Similar thing I have to do. For
this removing French. And just adding Italian and now it's selecting a different.
Range. I'll just give it the range that I want
and I just press. And so this is the number of times Italian
is repeated in column number B, so we can state in general if we have a problem statement How many movies are in English?
Five in the entire dataset, How many in French? Five How many, how many I didn't Italian six.
So we'll get a generalized V so I did not do anything on my own. I just asked Chargeability as in the system that, okay,
help me solve this part. So it did the second thing that we talked about was trim, right?
So I'll just ask Chargeability if there are unwanted spaces. I just asked if you did Odd
Uns wanted space in a certain
and the start, what syntax should I use and.
I'll just type it out and let's see what it has to say. Okay. So it gives me the exact command
that I was referring to. It gives me that. Okay, it knows you want to use trim because this is how you would get rid
of the unwanted spaces that I did like. It just mentions and gives me the exact thing
how to do it. So I'll just copy. I just created a. Column that.
Had it and I just write that thing here
straight. So trim it trimmed straight
string. E I would just start with it too. Right?
So now, not just straight ahead, correct
range. Right. I just make another column bolded. Maybe
right now this is the thing equal to trim those cell. I have to click on that.
I'll just type out the cell name. So what I would do, I'll just since it understands
this is drag and drop delivery and and now as you can see straight ahead in in rule number eight
there was this minute or much unwanted space rate in number 12 that was a number 17.
It was a 1918. So that extra space, that unwanted space is now gone. Right now you get a clear,
uncluttered view of that movie title column. This is how you use. Trim right.
Now. Let's just take another example, right? If I want a set number of characters. Right, if I want to extract,
let's say this is a net asset that gives me the name of that state, read Indiana, Delaware,
and or this in the county names with their pin code. Now, if I want to just extract the PIN code.
Right, I. Just want the PIN code to be out there. Right. How would I do that? I know that PIN code is off six letters
right there. Right. Six. All It is the same. Now I want to extract it. How would I do that? I don't know.
I would ask tangibly how to do that. So there's the size. How do I
draw five letters
in the left of a cell
and add the same? You know, you
got them right? So let's just. See what charge.
It reads to answer it. So as we also read before that we can use
oh, syntax goal as left read how to use that. Again, it has mentioned number of all use that.
I'll just copy. This. I just paste. Since I want it from the left of. The set, I just.
Paste this. Right. I'll just change the the cell to
B do I just add the number of. Characters I want to trade? I want six.
Letters, so I'll just move it to six. And there you. Go. I have extracted the first six letters here
and I can drag and drop to the entire thing, right? So this is the thing. So basically now the Jean
the shift of using Excel is how either you can learn how to use Excel. That's number one.
But if you don't want to sacrifice on that, if you just want to be a head, if you will, just one that my workflow is is smooth,
it's faster, it's quick, then I may not have the bandwidth or the or the time to learn Excel.
What I would do, I would just add type jiggly, how to do that. So now we extracted. So I now what would happen
is that I'm given a business problem. The first approach is to go route activity. Of course use your brain,
but the first element is to just know what charge it would be. Can answer it to give you some idea.
Of or the other. Right. So next we can also talk about can get right
we've spoke about how it is used but again let let me just show you how you can use it.
What if I want to combine two cells
and add it in any new
column? How would do that? Tell me. So it mentions
you have to use the function known as concatenate. The syntax is mentioned right here. I just copy syntax right here.
How to use it. Now the best part about charge it would be is it would give you a hands on vocal with this needs to be done
Also it will give you a bit of a brief of how how things are happening. Right.
It would not give you anything too vague. That is not true. Of course you can try it out. You can check it out.
But you can get what you want from it. Right. So I have you. Can get into it here instead of this.
I just changed my range right. Just I want this first name and.
Second name to come in the same thing. So there you go. I got it. I got the the name together.
Right. Similarly, I just drag and drop. To the very end and give me
the entire. Combination of column E and column B. Right, Right. So next.
So let's just see another thing. Let's just find out the number of characters
that they're there. Right. So how would I do that? How do I find
the count, the count of characters
in a single cell? How do I do that just type in.
So it's basically typing out what you are thinking. What you are thinking, right, is it gives me the
the thing that I can use equal to Len. And just straight out. So right now, count
is. Making the column. Count. Add my syntax. It is taking another set.
I just deleted this to dummy send it, just add send it to plus enter.
So it tells me. Okay mystery. One, two, three, four, five, 6789.
Gives me the correct order name. And similarly I can do. Now the point is
that it would also take into consideration this piece if I have a blank right, it will increase. It depends. Right?
So it takes in consideration of all the blanks. That are there as well. Right. The similar thing, if I just.
Don't want do so just want to send it to this one. So this would enter right.
And then the best spotting. And just drag and drop and it will come off the column.
Right. So these are the things that you can work on. Right. What if I want to calculate the weighted
average of, say, how would I do that right? So I just type in Calgary, the V weighted average rate.
So it would. Give me what is a parameter in which I have to do right. So it says that some product is
do the aspect that I need to look at right through it. I have to mention my range one, range two,
then some the sum of range two. Right. So this is how do the exact weighted
average will come, Right. So we can get that as well. If you want to. Read, what else can we do?
Let's just look at those. Some of the things. What if I want to create a dropdown list of a sale
rate of a range of a column? So what? How would I do that? How would I create the dropdown it state?
So I would ask it to tell me how. It is. Not One thing that you have to know about it is that
the things that are here write it in in a single trade. It has its own memory rate.
So if I'm just writing it down anything, I don't have to mention that. Okay, Tell me in Excel. In Excel in every prompt,
it would have the memory of the entire the this entire trade that we're talking about. Right? It knows that the context is about Excel.
It knows that all the things that we are talking about is of Excel. So it will just give that
the entire thing that will come up here. Right? So it is stating me that to create a dropdown list
with the values from B20, you can use data validation. Here's the thing, right? Select the range of sales.
You want to drop down this for example, as you create, go to the data tab index in the data validation
data validation dialog world Open Settings tab allow dropdown choose list. So so you can do it in this regard.
So anything that you have in your mind that that is even a wild thought that okay, this is the things
we can change in Excel, but you will have no clue how to do that. You can just type it out in Excel. It will definitely have
some of the other way to assist you on what you want to do right. This was about the general basic prompt
in which you can know what is happening, how it is happening, right. So now in this module, let's first
try and understand certain functions that I did. So you really do not need to know all this
Types of Functions in Excel
when you're walking around with with the tangibility knowing Excel. But I'll give you a brief about it
so that you would have a thinking, rethinking on how the functions also work along with how you can make chargeability
work around these functions. Right? So the first very important function that is there is known as count.
If so, what is that function? What does it do? So function that count the number of sets
that match a specific condition. Right? So in a range of things, what are the specific conditions that I opted for?
So I'll count it will count the number of cells that match that condition. So that is known as count if.
Now the basic syntax of a function when you write in Excel is equal to same,
then you would write the name of that function. Here it is. Count If so, I'll write count if I type without going f, then open
parentheses or open bracket, then the range I would select. So I would randomly click on Excel.
So how do we select the range? Let's say you have this data that we created so
Marines would be, let's say from the cell. So from the cell, let's have B three to, let's say
any and anything of that sort. Right. So this is are D 6362, right.
So from. B. Three to be 62 would be my reiterate.
So I would just drag drag it through the column and that would become orange
and the conditions that I want. So if I want to search the specific word, so I'll just put it in
in the inverted commas, just write that condition and close brackets and enter. So it would give me in that range
how many times that specific instance specific condition has been met. So this,
this is what gang def that's, that's the first function. The second function is length.
So a function that returns the length of a text things. Right. So what would be the length of that word,
What would be the length of that string. Right. So it would give me that number. So what is this index equal to.
L e n. Open bracket, the cell that I need to select close bracket. So that would be the second function.
The third is left and right. So if I want to extract the function that returns specific numbers,
specific number of characters from from a cell right, the left side or the right side
in that in a cell. Right. So it would give me the number of characters to left, the cell number of characters, right,
Cell number of characters. I'll tell you how it is important. How would you know that?
I would give you a brief. And that then is concatenate a function that combines multiple text
filled a single state. It's, for example, that, you know, if I want to combine a lot of multiple text
into one single cell, then Internet for example, I'll just take first name, second name.
I just want to merge it in one thing. Then I use concatenate Silva. I might write
and then is there trim function which removes extra unwanted space that I did from the cell state.
So this is enter trim command equal to trim open very this
the cell select that's includes bracket length. So let's just move around do chargeable edges understand
certain problems of this regard. Okay Liz's take an example of this data set right
in which I have a number of companies mentioned here random companies and it's revenue
per quarter to quarter one quarter quarter three and quarter four. Right now, if I want to know the sum of all these Right
sum of all of these, how would I know what would be the thing to know, though? The the sum from each cell.
Right. So I can just understand look at this cell number is what what is the cell name E2
What is the cell name here? E 20. Now I can just go to Judge O'Brien, right?
I just give data from that, right In an Excel Formula two out of the values
set E to true open. So from E to do you then what are the values
I want wanted to give me how I can do that, how I can sum I can just go to Excel
and just be like, I want to I open up a calculator and I just I individual values in sum it right.
It would not work in that regard. So what would I do? What would I do? So I would just ostensibly family man,
I don't know how to use Excel in this. Right. Right. In Formula two out of the values in cells E two through E 20.
Right. So I just I put out so now only give me the formula to out of the values and say it to the E 20 in in Excel
you can use some function. He has the formula. So as I already mentioned that is a function
right in Excel would start from inequality sign. Then the name. Now if I want to do some
it just gives me some and then open bracket the range. Right.
So I'll just copy paste this and let's see if it works or not. Great. I just randomly place it here
right now. I'll just put enter. No chargeability without knowing what the data is
without knowing what it is. It just tells me, okay, this is how you summit right now. I can just cross verify the thing
here, right? It just gives me equal to I'll put same formula
equal to some open bracket. I just click on the entire range of it here
and then no spread. And this is an index. So do you give me the same answer rates
is just that I did not know if I did not know if the thing called equal to sum, what should I do? Should I google it out?
It is a better way to just give it. Okay, this is the same. This is the thing I want to do. Just tell me how to do it right
so it can act as your assistant to just get rid of the mundane task that I did right
and can even ask you to make your dashboard of various things right. You want to analyze trains?
If you want to visualize a lot of things, right, you can ask it to give us different formulas or give it does index of how you can
modify the data, analyze the data, you know, manipulate the data in the regard in which your problem statement
the solution to your problem statements at made. Right. So the second aspect that I would be talking about
is let's just take another example now, let's just take this data set right there.
So data is a single log brace now. It has a lot of decimals right here. Right. But I don't want these kind of decimals.
I just want around round number to the closest value that is that. Right? So how would I do that?
How would I rounded off? I do not know. It certainly do. So I would just ask chargeability,
I would ask it to just give me that sort of thing and rewrite the formula to round a number
in a cell to the nearest whole number. Right. So I just ask it how does how to do that.
So it gives me that this is a command. It tells me, okay, this is a command called round. You can just
you type what it is. And now it also gives me a description of what it is. Now, I don't know what even is.
I don't know what zero is. Even again, understand that it is the cell different is the reference of that particular cell
now even refers to the cell containing the number you want to down. The second argument zero specifies
that you want to round it to decimal places, effectively rounding it to the nearest whole number. Right?
So it gives me in a very good m.a.a.d certain way that, okay, this is how you do it. You don't need to, you know,
bang your head around that. Okay, how to do it right? You can get easy solutions, easy good methods improving your productivity.
Right? Okay, So now if I want to round it over this piece to do it here, I'll just piece the formula
that Chargeability provided me so it is equal to around and the cell not even
is definitely not my cell. It just give me a dummy number here. So at just remove it done in the space.
And as I say, let's just say I want to do. This the. The rounding off what to set.
So I just click the cell key do and I don't want any decimal places so I just put ended. Right so.
I just remove the displacement here so that convenience in the same at all. So now it gives me the same thing. Right.
So now if I want this to be around it off, so what would I do? I will just drag this things here.
So what would happen is it will just apply all of these things,
just that Excel has that kind of green in which it will utilize for the role that you are providing.
Right? So it will know in that regard. See. So this is how it is there.
Now I have got another column right here that would give me the rounding off of that number.
Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts using ChatGPT
So in the income statement, how pivot table or pivot chart will work,
I will show you. So first we need to select the entire data. Okay.
After selecting the data you need to go for, insert it. You can see pivot table or recommended pivot tables.
You go to pivot table, click on that. So it will take like selected table range.
So Whatever the range just you require, you can select that particular range. You can type here also. Okay.
And use external data. If you want to use any external, you can choose here a new sheet or existing worksheet.
So in this seems you don't look, you can see what is a pivot table. I know that your chart looks like I
in the new attitude also you can see. So I clicked on the new attitude. Just click on. Okay so there you can select
which are old values adequate for example, adequate only to those are 19 to those in 2021.
Okay. All three years I was selected. This is your work income statement, correct.
The total revenues. Okay, this is easy, but. This is your pivot table. Correct.
So next, how to create pivot judgment after creating the pivot table. Next, you can go here.
You will find the pivot chart. Okay, in the same column. So just click on your chart.
And here, whichever unit the candle border or whichever
you request or it is comfortable, you can select and click on. Okay, See
all the information, all blue colors is visible in. So blue color is showing two.
Those are 19 information identical is to those and 20. And this gray color is true
those in 2021. So if you want only to those in 19 and 20 not required 2021.
So if you just click on 21 that is antique, then you can find only two. Those are 19 and two those and 20.
So if you require only one year, so to those are 19 and you need to convert to those are 19 and 2021.
So it just click on that and are also whatever you want.
So you're also are there so you can select the values drag and drop here and here.
Also, Robin is only the Ministry of Data and we have any other information you can drag and drop here
and the values. Okay, that is also there here only. So with this pivot table
and pivoted charts, also we can easily analyze the other financial statements so
and if you click on here, the filter symbol is visible right so you're also you can go and whichever you request
like only like first you can select all that is antique. Then you can select only total
gains, total expenses, total losses
and total revenues. So here in the to
those are 19 2000, 2021, we are comparing only this two years. Okay, what is our total expenses
and what is the total gain total losses and total revenues? So easily we can compare in the pivot chart.
And if you want 2020 also you can just click on that, you will get the information.
So if you comparatively total revenue and total expenses. So in 2021 only it highest,
the revenues also high and expense is also high. So this is all we need to
use the pivot table and pivot charts. So if for example, I know how to create
Pivot Table and Billboard charts so I can easily create if I'm not sure how to create below table and project,
so on that time. Also you can just as the chargeability. So that will give you the step
by step process to create the pivot table and pivot chart to analyze your data.
It may be financial data or whatever the data may be, so that will clearly it will give you the step
by step information to create hard are how to create your table and your chart.
So first is you are preparing our data. So already our data is prepared, correct? Next selected data.
And so what I've done, I was selected complete income statement, correct.
So next insert a pivot table. So the left side we are click on insert
before table. Next insert tab Excel pure table button
does the data source. So already selected. That is very unique, but that is true. Those are named in 2021
that we are selected correct. And data sources you want total expenditure or loss or total gain or net income,
whichever you require that you can select and select the location. Location in the sense
the new sheet or existing sheet. So if you are going through this step
by step, okay, rephrase deep water will analyze the data. So after the table and the graph is visible
easily, we can analyze the data of that financial statement.
Okay. So If you are not sure, then ask the deputy. That will give the in-depth step by step activity to create.
These are steps to create deep pivot chart and table. So now let's look at the various types
Types of Presentations
of PowerPoint presentations. The types of presentations are presented. So there are different kinds of presentations.
So Let's talk about them. So the presentations come in in various formats and styles
which are catering to the different communication needs and audience preferences. Now let's look
at some of the common types of of presentation based, right? So the first one is informative presentation.
So now what this is about, this is you currently seeing the slides that is there, right?
So this slide is basically what is the purpose is to provide information, to educate the audience
about the specific topic. So I'm talking about presentation. So this makes it a informative presentation type late.
So these presentations are content delivered, right? So this is a very important word right here that this is content driven
and the focus is to explaining the concepts and processes. So if we look about this current slide, right,
I have hit the right right here. So this is decoded we talk about. So then we have the content over
here, right? The context is defined over it, so this makes it informative presentations in which
it is good to have a written text and it's okay if there is no image.
So the purpose is to make an audience understand a particular concept. So for example,
when I was explaining to you about the various steps, right, I used something known as a flow diagram.
So this, the purpose is to make them understand. So first what will happen is train training Djibouti,
then spreading, then so. So do we have this structure right? This is in a flow
type of information, right? So this is good for an informative presentation. It
then you have persuasive presentations, right? Maybe the goal here is to persuade a group
or set of group of audience, maybe to adopt a particular viewpoint, right idea or a course of action.
Maybe in a business setting. In a business meeting, when someone is talking about, let's see, what are the future
prospects of of X, y, z commodity or x, y, z things? Wait, so you need to tell them
why my idea is better. Right? To the goals of that presentation is to persuade the audience know
you will do anything to make them believe that what you are doing is right. So the structured will be in such a way that
they adopt a particular at the end of the presentation and then this demonstration
or the product presentation. Now what is this about? This is about, for example if you're selling mobility
and the product is selling and you're creating slides, you want to reach a lot of audience,
you're talking about that particular product. How would that show the that would be a probably
keeping that product picture in the slide. Then talking about that slide, talking
about the various elements of product. So that would be of a more related to a product presentation, right?
So these presentations showcase a product or service. The focus is highlighting
the features, benefits and value of offering, right? So this is also very, very important type of presentation.
So basically in a nutshell, what you create depends on what type of presentation it is.
So basically in a product presentation, you cannot create an informative presentation in which
you do not have, let's say, any sort of images and uses describing the product, because at the end the audience have to visualize
what you're talking about, right? So in order to do that, if it is a product demonstration or a product presentation,
then the product should be the image of the product is the key to make them understand or resonate
what you're talking about in a more efficient manner. So these presentations showcase
how a product or service works, right? So this is about demonstration or the product presentation.
Then then it is conference and presentations. You might have been to, let's say,
a research conference or let's say it, an event in which you are a keynote speaker, so delivered in these conferences
at large events. Keynote presentation set the tone of the event and often featured
influential speakers sharing insight, trends and thought provoking ideas. Now, this type of presentation
may include a lot of diagrams, a lot of images, because you bring to a large audience.
Let's say you're presenting it in a large auditorium. There are hundreds of people, thousands of people sitting maybe.
So getting those fonts bigger for them to see. Look at focus on trade,
using certain elements that are large, certain elements that are small. The one that is large
would have a greater chunk in which you would be delivering to them. So the focus would be that aspect, the part in which though
the text would be smaller or the images would be smaller, would hold significantly less
amount of time while presenting, or the focus would be a bit less, then come fields
or picture presentations. Now what does this no fields or pitch presentation is basically designed
to persuade the potential customers or investors to buy a product or invest in a project.
Right now, this presentation emphasizes the value of proposition the market need and the competitive advantage
that it would have. Right? So this would be about the sales that is there. Then there's something known as
elevator pitch. No elevator pitch are considered to be a very short pitch, maybe
in a slide or two. The aim is that it should be as quick as you're
going from ground floor to and floor. So the amount of you would take in an elevator is equivalent
to the time of presentation you would have. So this is the situation is elevator pitch presentations
so concise and compelling presentations that can be delivered within the time it takes to write an elevator.
It's used to introduce oneself or no business idea very quickly. So this type of presentations
would mainly let's see, have a title slide, a big header right there.
Then maybe the second slide is all about the infographics in which you have a lot of flow
diagrams, a lot of dodge, something of that sort would be in a much more greater depth,
but it would not exceed one too. Max Not More than that, right?
So that would be the and the best part about an elevator pitch is
it would be heavy on content, not necessarily B text mode,
which will contain, but it would not go more than two slides that for sure, this may be filled up to a lot of
the tongue. They would not be in space. It may be like a collage or letter word cloud sort of thing,
but it would not be more than two slides, that's for sure. Now let's talk about
Key Elements of a Presentation
what are the key elements of the presentations we talked about with the various types of presentations. But now let's dive
deep into what the various elements of a presentation. We talked about the various types
of presentations, but now let's focus on the element inside the presentations are the various elements.

So the key elements include number one is the title slide. What is the release date?
I'll just show you in my presentation itself, something this sort right where the resemblance is a big hit it
right, hit a big header, then you would have something to distinguish it.
Eight So this is the format. Then you also have, let's say, a template
for the presentation, right? So this slide would be the first slide of the presentations, which is known as a title
slide. Okay. Then. So that's what we talked about the title
say the first slide, include presentation title, your name, the date, possibly the name of the organization
or institution. Right. So the second part is introduction. Now a brief introduction slide
that sets the context for your presentation and outline what you'll be covering.
So it may have a byline. Let's say that this topic is about this
particular thing, right? There be a very short byline that outlines what you're covering.
It's not necessarily popular in the current scenario in which you just have a title slide
and then you move on to the agenda. Okay, So agenda slide is, a slide that lists the current main topics
or the sections of the presentation so that the audience know what to expect. Today. For example, I had as an agenda, right?
I had four pointers. Now this is my first main point, right? First main point
and this is my second main point. But this is my main point and this is my fourth main point.
So what is this required? Why is this required Now? This point should act as a filler
for my upcoming modules. Let's see. Eight. So this comes out now. How do I distinguish this?
This is a slide in reason. Just the topic is in this slide you don't have extra specifying border
to this. You just have a normal, let's say a normal text written a slide known as slides.
Why is this important? Distinguish number one from this slide because I do slide has a much more elevated,
much more intrinsic, more clear ideal that this is the title slide in.
This is just normal slide in which the title is written. So the point is of the agenda will act as a slide or this module starts
in a presentation. Then you have, let's say, of these charts and graphs,
visual representations. Right now it is a sales pitch, or if it is an elevator
pitch or different. So let's say any sort of keynote which the darts and graph play a lot of,
if you go ahead and see a lot of TED talks, what whatever the presentations, the present would either have a graph
or a visual representation. Maybe a photo in the middle of the slide, Right.
Maybe a photo in the middle of the slide. And then you'd have this story done around that picture, right?
This be the main element then, or maybe the case. There would be.
It is a very technical sort of thing. You would have little scatterplot read a line plot, bar graph or histogram.
Then you talking about that in the end, then you don't have a much sort of text. You would have a graph, you would label the graph
of course x, y, what this represent, what does this axis represent? And then you would talk around that part
in the presentations, use visual representations of data to make the complex information
more digestible and understandable. Right? You don't want your presentation to have a lot of complex jargons
because then the attention of the learner would go away. They would probably scroll their phones and not look at your presentations,
but you don't want that. You would want them to be who don't do what you are speaking and what you're showcasing.
It becomes really important to start off with. Right. Then. Transitions are very important, right?
And smooth transitions or animation. So this is usually done when it is
sort of either in formal presentation or if it is something that is not very
what do we call animations would be something that transitions are good. Animations
may make it a more informal presentation, right? When you have a lot of little floating things coming
on, lot of jumping things coming on, right? You have those animations in the presentation.
They smooth transitions is when let's say you have a flowchart that you have
of no process that is different. So what would happen in a smooth transition?
This would come first, this would be the second, this would be third. So when you click next,
so only this will be displayed. Then this will be displayed. Then this will be displayed in a step by step manner.
So that is something that is really familiar. You can use that any sort of settings, but the animations are
a bit more informal approach to try not using too much of animations in your next.
Then it would be more like creating a school level presentation and not something that would be
a university order or a corporate sort of presentations.
Then this example, then case studies if applicable, include a real world example orchestra.
So one of the best methods to engage your audience, one of the best methods to make your audience appeal
or hook to your presentation is through example, in case studies rate, people always remember this.
People always resonate with real world examples and the real life case studies that are there
because it adds credibility to the presentation, which is very, very important. Then also you can use,
if it is something that is emotive fashion presentation, are the relevant codes you can add from experts
or if maybe two things today, if you're talking about selling a particular product,
they talk about the actors that you have that are there. Your brand ambassadors do spoken about that particular product.
You can add codes if it is a model instance or you can add quotes from various world leaders, various famous personalities,
and you can make your presentations more desirable, more interactive, more relevant to the scenario.
So these are the various key elements that are there. Also, one of the major aspects is to focus on the
content slides. Now, content slides are the mean body. For example, in an email
you have a subject, you have the header, you have the first byline of some sort,
have the main body text, and then you have the ending to the email. Similarly, in a presentations,
you have your opening of the presentation, you have the ending, the summary part. But then in the middle
it is what we call the mean body text. How would you indulge when you deep dive into later
technical jargons when you talk about mean context of the presentations, which is not too fancy.
So that is when you have to be clear and concise with your points. Now each slide
should have both single point and I would clutter on the slides. They don't use a lot of pen
while explaining that may make your presentation not
avoid clutter and keep concise, Then use relevant images, charts, graphs
and diagrams to complement your points and make your presentation more engaging and bulleted list.
When you're presenting key points, use a bulleted list. What is it? Readability, font and color.
Ensure that the font size is large enough right now. Font also plays a very critical role, right?
If you are, let's say if you're here it is of let's say text related 32. X.
Font size 32 and your bodies of essays nine which you also give a very
bad feeling the header is too big and the condenses the mean body text is very small.
That's also not good enough to create a margin. You have to make sure that your head that is clearly visible
but not overly visible, that it disrupts the audience from looking at the presentation.
Then the color, right? You don't want use. You can use a lot of bright colors
to highlight specific points. But let's say let's assume that if I were to make this entire thing red,
how would that feel? That would not be good, right? So let's say that if I make this light
a very bright color, let's say if I put a very, very bright color indeed, let's say red.
Right. It's very not appealing, then it's not soothing.
It's like something written in red, which is also not good. Right. If I make it to do, let's say,
a very bright colored, it's a yellow. I cannot read anything right. So it has to have that
readability, has to have that sense of things. And when you have to do bold
to focus on a specific point, then that relevant point bold, if not, then leave it.
So that's how you have to make your presentations more engaging. So in this module,
Creating Content using ChatGPT
let's talk about creating content using tangibility. By content I mean the slides are
let's create a presentation, but let's first look at the interface of tangibility.
Let's look at how the dashboard of Tangibility is. Let's have a hands on on that if I open up So it's injured right?
You can take Google anything that you. Read and. Then I will type in. Head
right and search. For tangibility. Now the first link that comes is tangibility by opening a right.
We know it's made in the lab. By opening I would click on that. So now I have logged in into
my account currently and so
I have logged in. So let's look at a brief view of what tangibility is about. So What you get is two models
that are depicted, 3.5 and four. So now what is a difference?
Basically, Tangibility 3.5 is a free for all is for anyone and everyone to use.
DPD Ford is a paid version of it, right? I have bought the paid version
so I have Whittamore, the GP, for 3.8. So what happens is what is the difference between the two?
Let's look at this. I open the eyes.
Of website, so if you open the website I will come across a lot of things,
read it, see if I want to look at the two most famous products by opening that dischargeable date 3.5 and four.
Right. So loan let's look at the model GP before that is the latest model by open area.
So let me know how it is more than once. Right. So do you believe what is in open is most advanced system
which gives much more logic correct logically sound results than its previous model
that is GP 3.5. So now what has happened in Djibouti for the neural engine
is of much higher accuracy. It has much more understanding in problem solving abilities than its predecessor,
so it has much more logical reasoning aspect to it. So If you add a lot of heavy,
let's say, logical reasoning questions, it is much more suited to solve it than its predecessor.
3.58. However, the speed of Djibouti four is slightly slower
because it has much more problems and the back end algorithm is in such a way
that it takes more time to give you results. But the the accuracy is much more in Djibouti
four than in Djibouti 3.5. So now, see, Djibouti for is more creative
collaborative than ever before. It can generate in it and iterate with the users. And creative and technical
writing does suggest composing, writing, screenplays, or learning or uses writing code.
So for example, if I give Djibouti for that, I write a poem on on, let's say, any topic,
but every word in that one should start with the letter M, So it will give me that result.
It will make a poem will generate a poem from scratch, which is not, by the way,
copied from anywhere, but does create a new one for me, which would start
which would have all the words that starts with the letter. And now in Djibouti, four passes, Djibouti
three in the advanced reasoning capabilities, they have given the input. Djibouti 3.5 that is chargeable
is different from Djibouti forward rate. So in the person the child rankings. Right.
So 90th percentile that so that's like top 1% of the class right.
That is the result that Djibouti four got when it gave these exams rate
when it was run the exam to run through these so it give 90th percentile that is basically
all impaired level things. They top 1% rate right in Biology Olympiad
it is 99th percentile. That's basically a top rate. So that's how it once
it has become red compared to its previous models. So it is ongoing, the research is ongoing.
Openai is still developing these modules, but as it mentions, right, that Djibouti
for is if you do percent less likely to respond to request that this load containing 40%
more likely to produce factual responses, read more factual accuracy than its predecessors.
So that's why Djibouti food is a really, really popular but it is going to be paid with good. The monies are good,
but Djibouti forward is a much better model in terms of response and everything. Right?
So now coming back to the topic, here's the good dashboard on it. You can write your problems
in this message box here in which you can write your problems and you can send your problems or whatever it is. Right?
And this is basically the thread rate, the threads, whatever the threads are there that would be in this black
section right here. So you can add new chart from here, you can close this site.
But when you are. You know, asking or. Writing your problems
of particular topics, you can minimize that. Right? So one thing is that Djibouti, right
this has learned and trained the data rate. Whatever it has trained
is up to 2021, September 2021. Anything that is after that,
it does not know if I asking what is the data data rate or maybe. Or if I asked them what is two days
breaking news across the world.
They it would not give you because it will write here. I apologize that I do not have real time
capabilities. My knowledge extends up to September 2021 to really give you directly that I have not been trained to.
You don't talk about what is happening in the world currently because my knowledge is up to date until 2021.
So one disadvantage. That's one drawback that Djibouti has that it's not aware
about the current things that are happening. If there is any change in certain things it would not know. Right.
But on the other hand now I can delete, I can copy paste this if I want from here I can. So this is for there
we back in understanding that this was good. So if it was good, then they would have a bad image.
This is giving good result. If not, then I could good. Put the thumbs on one day
then would know what I do in giving them the feedback that this was not helpful. This isn't true.
So you can get the loan on that one, right? So currently since I use 3.5, so it showcases me
that it's default more than 3.5. Now coming back to our topic in which we were talking about
how to create a presentation, how to create slides, our Djibouti. Right? So in this scenario, in this context,
let's start off by picking another random drop in. Let's say it's the climate change for that matter.
Now will put certain prompts and create an entire deck. How I like
how I want the deck to be using Djibouti, right? So for better results, logistic
or Djibouti for more and let's just type in are I prompted.
Okay, so. My first prompt would be quite generic. I would not do many details in it,
but when you are talking on Djibouti phone model, if you give them various parameters,
then it is much more helpful. Otherwise, Djibouti point five and what would be the same? So if you have a lot of parameters, let's say climate of going to talk
about climate change or the topic about climate. So I would have, if I want to input a lot of parameters
in it. Talk about the audience in the Asia-Pacific region know about what is happening
historic, coal data, how the global warming has has started or is on the rise.
What what are the various greenhouse gases? All that we if I have to talk, I can give them the parameters
to talk about. Right. So all that we will see. Let's get into it. Let's dive deep into it. So let's just type in first.
What should I name it? Let's say
if I have to create, oh, let's say
BP on the topic climate change,
would you suggest me some Getty
Images for it might be pretty
cool. Let's just type in legit see what it gives me right now, given that I have to create a people
on the topic. Climate change. Could you suggest some catchy titles for my people? Did I know if you give me a list of
of fun to not give me one or two ones is it will give me a list a good chunk of more than 20 or 20
results right and I can pick from the rate. Oh it is a tipping point. Understanding climate change
Unraveling the climate conundrum. The heat is on decoding climate change.
So all this is given. All I can do is read. Let's just take any random thing.
Let's just say.
It is just the
existing. This one right. Earth is at the tipping point.
Now, if I want to create, can you create oh, let's say
I want to create a byline. Date by line for this day to
you know so. Also. Right. If I do not know, I have just heard the term byline and I not know what byline actually is.
So what would happen is that I would just give certainly a byline can help provide a little more context
or to highlight the unique perspective of representations. Right. So decoding or writing the bridges
and the fight for survival. And then so it basically gives me a byline as know
what I have to do is I have to ask GGP to give me an entire slide.
How much is the amount? I will specify, but to get an entire deck out of it, a slide deck out of it.
So let's just do that. So now I will talk about the year.
Slide the slide deck or for
let's if we're doing slides highlighting. I just was given a random dump.
About climate change, right?
So I'm just. Giving it that clear the slide deck before the slides about climate. You know, make sure that the context here
is that you do not have time to make presentation. Let's just say that you have to make a presentation
next day or the day after it and you're running low on time. So what would you do? You would make use of tragedy.
So that's all this is about right? So now this. So let's see the result.
Now here's the proposed structure for the 14 slide PowerPoint presentation. Now slide
number one is about title slide. So I have already chosen Earth at the Tipping Point Understanding
Climate Change. Now, this is the beauty of understands what you have asked
before in the same thread. If I'm talking in the same thread, right, this is the new chart in the same.
If I'm talking to Chargeability right, it will understand what I have spoken before.
Didn't understand would have I have input before? Did it have that memory in the same thread?
Right. So now it understands that my title that I selected is at the tipping point. Understanding climate change
right in grams before I did this one. Right. So I do understood
that from this entire dump I have chosen this part right? And it gives me after two prompts.
It gives me the same thing in the title and state title. Is this subtitle of
this is Decoding or is Writing and Right for survival rate. So it gives me the first one head
because I did not really specified if I would have it would have given me the the one that I wanted it.
Now it seems that my slide one should be the title slide. This is I it in the key elements.
The first ladies always the title slide. Then is the introduction. A brief introduction about climate change, its causes,
why it's important to understand and address it right then defining climate change this or this.
Now, if I'm not happy with this, right. If I'm not happy, it has given me
those things, I can ask it to make it better. Right? So now what I'll do is
I love slide number two. That is introduction, right. So I'll copy paste this right here
and I'll paste the prompt below. And what will I do? I will just write and elaborated
this point. Now I have to think in this perspective, if it is introduction slide,
how many pointers do I need? Do I need to add images or do I need to add more x? Right.
So elaborate this. Let's say I find legislative. One more point should be did. More for valuable
bullet points. Points
or elaborate this point and for valuable. Point. And I
start the example from history.
History. Okay, so. Now I'll give it this form. Let's see what the result is.
So slide number two read a brief introduction about elaborate this point in for valuable points.
It will give me the dump that okay, this is the thing. What is climate change?
Climate change refers to a long shift in temperatures and weather patterns, particularly
a rise in global temperatures. Right? You study the little ice age. A period
from the 14th century to the mid-19th century illustrates, the natural climate variability.
During this period, temperatures drop by only about 1%. But it was enough to freeze
the River Thames in London, causing widespread corruption inside. So I asked. Him to write.
As the judges would be modern. Give me four valuable points and Article 38 example.
Now I wanted to add, okay, yesterday what what it did is it added orchestrating each point death rate,
which is what I did not want write. So I'll write here. Just give me one case that would be
in the above answered
in the above. One answered and just give me one case. Study the above answered and.
Keep the point. Does up to one Right.
Let's make it during two months.
Now let's see if it understands. On not eight. Yeah. So give me the thing.
Understanding climate change, the causes in. I asked to give it in to write it, give me to do two lines.
And then I asked one. You studied it. One Just give me one give study. So now it gives me one.
Give study to the Dust Bowl of 1930s in the United States. The example of a climate event by human activity
for farming practices like the widespread soil erosion and dust storms, creating a decade long drought.
Although not directly related to today's global issue, there is demonstrated how human actions can dramatically.
No, this is something not. If I have to verify this, I can go and I can write it in Google and see if this is accurate or not,
which you should do any content that you put or go forward from. I think from tangible.
Be it needs to. Be much more clear, number one,
in terms of the facts if they are wrong, you need to cross verify it. If you have any doubt cross verify it because it would be
is accurate up to some level. But you need to make you need to cross-check because. It may be wrong at times.
It's not fully up to the point in which there are no errors. There are errors. There are things
that are factually incorrect. So you need to also take that one does make. But since climate change is a very generic topic
in which you don't need it to address a lot of, you know, technical terms.
So this much easier for for making a presentation for sure.
So understanding the climate change, the causes the need to address is the importance of illness.
So now I have four kiddos in this things. Okay, let's now talk about
how to add these slides in PowerPoint presentation. So What I'll do is what I have got here
right now. I want to. Elaborate it right. So
I'll just that I just read it so there's this option here where you can modify the current prompt, right?
So I'll add shift ended and then I'd. Add for let's say five
short pointers in each
section, each
section. So I'm. Going to split the word. Correspondence.
So you disappointed in Section three? Let's see what the result is.
So now what happens is it would give me an iteration that it would give me.
Okay, so this was my first iteration. This is my second iteration. So it will give me from now
that extends the title slides cannot have a 4.1 to thing, so it will not give me
those kind of four pointers. Now this gives me a lot more point.
Does advice. Four. For pointers are giving me five pointers that is that now
I want to add this in my ability, so I'll just go to create a new.
Okay. So what I'll do is I'll refresh this and I'll, I'll click on the right partner
and I'm clear Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, right. And name it as climate change.
Climate change. If I double click it, I'll open it. Now this is what comes up.
It's the PowerPoint that opens up. Now, I want to add a new slide, right?
So can I can. Include this slide that is right there. Then I can add.
Subsequent slides straight. Then I need. Delinquent and. Then I can have much more.
So slide number one, let's see what what it has given me. Right. So it does give me forces.
The title slide is either tipping point of climate change. So I'll.
Click on this and copy paste. This. Then I've
at this climate. Altered the tipping. Point right at this.
So this is currently f 54. Let's just. Move to 42
and then just change this to basic Ghalib three and.
I can hold it. And I wanted it. Now if want to add a sublime by line rate
that can also be done. Decoding words. Rising temperature and
and this I can drop it. So this is generally in.
Less than one in let's say, oh, I
went. More smaller than the previous so I kept this one as what you do this one I'll keep this 20.
Four or 24, this is fine. So I'll keep this 24. Now this is my title slide right there.
Right. So this one is sorted. Now, the second one is adding the content. The second one is about
introduction, right? Introduction. I didn't either type or I just copy paste it.
Introduction to and just say climate change.
Okay. So it comes up in bold automatically at 44, but I'll reduce it.
To 3236. Let's just take it or I'll just give them a 26.
Okay. And I word it's already bold is perfect. And I can add the content
straight away from. What it has given me.
Eight definitions, brief explanation, introduction and everything. Right.
So now if I want to add an on this slide, I'm not happy with the flow rate historical overview.
I'll just click on this then I
Okay. So it has given me this response, but I think I want to let's say I want to have in
third slide introduction. I just. Have this definition. Of climate change re introduction. Right?
So now these are my mean Windows eight, but I can't really write definition of climate change state.
So what I'll do is a lab. Would read
on slide two and I could use
on terms rate. So now if you go back and think what this is about now
climate change. Reference, it has. Given me that it refers to the temperature. Some things. Yeah.
Weather patterns and temperatures. It includes both global warming driven by human induced emissions of greenhouse gases
and the resulting. So what I'll do is I'll just copy this.
And then just basis. So since it's the introduction,
the first pointer is about will be about.
About climate change right. Then second would be its universal effects.
Is just effects. Yeah. So second, I'm talking about what other global impact it will have.
So I'll add that structure right there. Right
now, if I feel
not if I feel that this is so I. Just put the textbook.
I just say for in be okay your warming is going.
To make it into textbooks and make it less 24. Right. And if I want to justify this rate,
let's just say that I don't want to use empty spaces or I'll just. Copy paste. I'll just control. J So the text would be
from line to line format, Okay. So it would be justified as mostly happens.
In a research paper of some sort, right? Then I want in the second page
I want something else. Let's say the. Topic on this significance, right?
So I'll go this space here. I just have an equal so I can write in that one.
Now I. Want to include another slide in. Which this is that. So let's just say that would be
the third slide. Now if I want to include so I don't want to include something
huge, something. Else in this, I'll just copy this right.
So it will read on
the morning. That's right. So this can happen.
So basically anything and everything that you want can be done through this, right? You don't need to
look around a lot of places when you're running short of time. Make sure that the the content is less
technical because then you would have to verify a lot. But in cases of, for example, this rule of common dose and B, notice
I would want to go and verify whatever this is rated rate is correct or
is are the greenhouse gases correct or not? So within which I can see is correct,
by the way. But, you know, you have verify it. You have to go and verify it.
So what what is this? Now? I can use pointers. I can just go ahead and add the pointers,
right head right so I can have the pointers. So now what is the best part about
this is let's just take that. I want the study to be presented right?
Or I can ask them for a historical case study on climate change. Let's modify some part.
So I'll write for historical case on climate change. Can you add this to the exam
and I'll write. So from the very start
it is giving me responses like the like age necessarily of 2003.
You been hit with the cold arctic ice melt and all that. So this is giving this now
I can on these case studies in my presentations or what I can do with also a note from I want to introduce this
The developer slider inducing the main objectives of climate change campaign include bullet points
highlighting, the key goals and start used to be implemented. Right. So what does this mean? This means that
increasing the awareness key goals influence policy rate. Policy changes need to be introduced,
engaging communities inspired actions. Right? So various strategies to implement is education programs, policy advocacy.
So all these things to know the key goals are written. So how the what it was structured in key goals and strategies
so really give me two different things now if it's my choice, if I add it or not. So let's just dive in another thing,
let's just see what it gives. That is one. So designers laid slide during timeline of important historical events
in climate change movement. Utilize the horizontal layout and adaptive descriptions to eat each event to provide context so
so if though the prompts a little more linear. So do you believe food has ability
higher order reasoning rate so it can give you better results in that scenario? Right. So the timeline
it is giving me in time 1979 were to the various things First World Climate Conference,
then Kyoto Protocol, all this Paris accord that happened in 2015.
So that's also mentioned here. Right? So all the things are mentioned here, how they are. Now, if I want
do have this right, so give me this was the most popular one, right? So
elaborate on this. If I want. To give a case study much more depth.
So I will add a program that would make make it much more bigger. Now,
if I read news, I would know that there was a Paris Accord in 2015. So what would happen is
if I give fictions in which I want to talk more about rate. So these are the elements that I can use,
right? So this will be coming, you know, in a decade if I have to make a lot of changes.
So I will what I can. The changes to the design aspect of it, I can make it
look how it's supposed to be date. I can add changes to the slides. I want the slides to be right
so this can be modified. I you can play around the functionalities of it, but to create a crystal deck,
this is what is needed, right? You can what you can also is if
that is that that kind of space, what you can do is you can also add
extensions to the PowerPoint, which you can basically you have to dump what algebra
gives you and it automatically give the response to it. So now we have got the content up.
VBA code in PowerPoint
So one other way you can, you know, ease your process of not copy pasting it to slide deck
or to the Microsoft PowerPoint is through a process called as
VBA. Right so what it is let's look at
so I will just do one thing, I just create a dummy presentation, right.
So I'll build an anti presentation as you can see. So what will happen is that I will input in.
This. Vehicle to create the vehicle
of these slides. Right. So since the slides will not create the entire one word, logistic or dummy example,
I'll ask you to create a visual code. So now here, I didn't make a PowerPoint vehicle for this
to run on Microsoft. PowerPoint right? So let's see what the result is about.
So now it has given me all the code red that is the media code that can be copy
pasted in PowerPoint and the slides will be there. Right? So let's just copy paste this code.
Let's go to the presentation that I've created. So I'll click on this then do it.
F11 So what will happen is that it will
open up this window. Right now what I have to do is I have to create have to go on insert,
create a new module. So this new module is created. They know what I'll do is I'll copy
the code that was there in to give me for VBA. So, so this is basically visual basic
for applications. What it does is this is your process of making a presentation So if I run it like
if I was, how do you run it? So if I. Run it. My, it will automatically create
these two slides from the dump this was a dummy. So too you can create more if you want.
So you don't individually need to add the content in there, right? So that's how you
make your process easier. And you just have to dump what that deputy has given you and create VBA for it.
You can copy paste VBA in your presentation and make the entire slide deck. So how can we? It is right.
So this is all about VBA. Now let's explore how you can boost your capabilities
in digital marketing and finance. First, we'll move on to chat Jeopardy
for digital marketing and learn how this I can craft compelling marketing
campaigns, optimize ad performance and engage with your audience effectively.
Then we will explore Chat Jeopardy for finance and see how you can assist
in financial analysis forecasts and providing insights
to make informed decisions. Ready to dive in. Let's get started
with these powerful applications of jeopardy. All right, so now that you understand
ChatGPT for Drafting Emails
what exactly is artificial intelligence and what is jeopardy, it is time for us to actually dive in
in all these different concepts related to content creation. And as you can understand how we can leverage
the power of Jeopardy. So first of all, in this particular module will be talking about Jeopardy
for drafting emails. When we talk about emails and different email drafts, how can judge help us do it?
So there are different areas where Jeopardy can actually help us. Number one is subject lines.
Whenever you send an email, there's a subject line that is that, and subject line is actually one
of the most important things about any email. Let's say you are sending a job application to an agent,
whether the job is going to open your email or not open your email, that completely depends upon catchy.
Your subject line is similarly as an organization or as a business owner. If you are sending
an email to your customer, whether they are going to open it or they are completely to ignore it, that completely depends
upon the subject line. So how can you generate some catchy subject line that can be done with the help of JWT?
And we'll see how exactly that can be done. Let it be distinct. Let's say you want to have two different variations of this object.
Like number one is something and number two is close to that. That isn't the same.
Then it is in a different way, phrased in a different way. You want to check which one is working and which one is not working.
That's nothing but AB testing. So if you want to have variation for subject line or for email body
or for something else, that can also be done with the help of JWT, then translation, whether they want to translate it
from English to Hindi or Spanish or Japanese, that can be done to then personalization.
If you want to change the tone of it to more personalized, more engaging, all of that can be done proofreading.
If you are writing an email, which is extremely important. Let's say you are sending it to potential investors.
As a business owner, it should not have any grammatical or punctuation errors, so how can you proofread it?
Roach activities. The answer then If you want to create some generic templates, let's use sending an email to the JD.
Sending an email to a candidate rejecting their profile or accepting their profile.
How can we get These are templates that can also be done with the help of J.A.. The response draft.
Let's say we got an email and you need to draft in response for the scene. How will you do that? JD really can help you
in that area as well. And then of course email body to So these are the different areas where JWT can help us
when it comes to drafting emails and now it is time for us to go to each activity and use that tool
in drafting emails that we are talking about over here. So first of all, to tell you how exactly to go about using beauty,
let me put in a random query saying Can you create email templates for me? Let me ask JWT and let's
see how it gives us different output. So if I type in the query, can you create email templates for me
it is. Sure. I'd happy to help you create some email template. Please let me know what type of emails
you need templates for and provide any specific detail requirements you have in mind. Here are some
of email templates for common use cases. So this one is business interruption. Immense. It is talking about the recipient name
and then the email body and then finally the salutation. All the things are given in not very good way.
Similarly job in going to email and then it is giving it more examples related to some follow up email
and all these different templates are provided. Now let me put up a case and let me ask Deputy if it can give me the email template
for a very specific situation. Let me say that I am a business owner. I need to send an email to my customers
informing them about the upcoming 25% discount on all my products that I am offering in my organization.
Can You generate a template for me. Let me put in this very and see what are the different results that we get.
So as you can see, if I type in the query, I'm a business owner and I need to send an email to my customers
informing them about the upcoming 25% discount on all my product. And I'm asking Judge
to generate a template for me. So if I press enter, you can see it is going to give us an answer. It says, Sure,
here's a template for an email informing your customers about an upcoming 25% discount
on all your product. It is giving me a subject line saying Exclusive offer 25% discount on all our products.
Then it is talking about your customer name. We hope this email finds you well as a valued customer of this and this company,
we are excited to share some great news with you. We are thrilled to announce an exclusive limited time offer
for all our loyal customers and at the end you see it says Thank you for your continued support and we look forward to serving
you during this special offer. Honey, this exclusive discount won't last long. It is getting a call to action as well,
and it is giving us a note that please customize this template to filling in the necessity details
such as the standard duration of the offer, promo code and contact to make it relevant
to your specific business and customer base. So that is the power of air if you are talking about
when we come to Chargeability. So you put in some information related to that. You want a 25%
discount, you are a business owner and you are sending this email to your customers. And we just asked for a simple template
that we want to charge you to create for us, and it give us a wonderful template. Now we can use it as it is,
or we can make some changes depending upon the business requirements or not specific needs. Now let me Jeb Deputy
if it can make the ABO mil specific to, let's say my clothing brand, I said that I am a business owner.
Let's say I'm the business owner of a clothing brand. And now let me ask Jeb Deputy can you make the about mil specific
to my clothing brand And here you go. Suddenly here's a revised version of the email template delivered
for a clothing brand exclusive, all for 25% discount on all your clothing brand name product.
So you see the difference. Initially, we didn't talk about particular bank thing exclusive over 25% discount on all our product.
But as soon as we mention about the clothing brand, it is picking up the hand and it is giving a revised version
of that same template. You can see the deal customer name in here. You can see that it is talking about things
related to clothing brand, whether you have been eyeing that perfect of jeans, that stylish dress or that cozy sweater,
now is the time to grab it at an incredible price. Are clothing brand name
collection features. The latest trends in fashion made from premium materials and design with exceptional craftsmanship.
So that's the beauty of Jeju Beauty. It gives us some amazing result in form of some catchy phrases.
So that's how we can use Jeju body when it comes to content creation for drafting emails.
Now let me ask Jet2 if it can make the same content piece email more catchy
and engaging for the customers. Let me type in the query. Can you make it more catchy and engaging for the customers?
And here you go. Here's an updated version of the email template that adds a more catchy and engaging tone
to entice your customers. Hear The words are changed. Now, if you see the subject line
flash sale alert, get 25% off all our clothing brand names. Stay here. Customer Name.
Are you ready for some serious fashion savings? We have got an exclusive offer just for you. Get ready to your wardrobe
with our hoodies. This and this brand name styles at an unbeatable price. And all the other information is provided
better by better, as you'll see. And it is very very eye catchy and can grab the attention of any customer
who's going to open that image now, let's say. But you feel that this is a very good sample. But again, it is too low and.
You won't judge a beauty to make it more concise. So let me put in the credit. This is too long. Can you provide a more concise version
of this email template? Let's see what other results we expect. And certainly here's
a concise version of the email template for your clothing. Then how do you 25% of all these
in this brand name styles? Hi guys. My name. But any profession deal you can't resist get 25% off on all different
clothing brand name styles for a limited time only and you see the duration and the length.
This particular email is very, very length and shorter compared to the previous sample. So that's the beauty of tangibility.
If you get an answer and you want to tweak it a little bit, let's say you set activity to make it more engaging,
do make it more personalized for the customers, to make it more empathetic for the customers. You can do all those changes

so that they are not just opening and they also have the courage to. Go and find your resumé

Let me ask Jed Deputy, to give me a few suggestions in terms of that email draft that I can send
to the heart of a potential employer or a potential organization that I wish to join.
Let me put in that information and see what other results we can expect. So as you can see on your screen,
if I put in the query, I am a computer science or CRM engineer from I.T. But maybe three years of relevant experience
in this development. Can you suggest an email template that I can use to send my resumé to the heart
of a potential employer? He has done so. He has an email template for sending your resume. The chart of a potential employer
subject is application for this in this position and your name? Do your job. Contact name.
I hope this email finds you, but my name this and I am a highly skilled computer science engineer

to understand the tone of what you are actually asking and then provide you a solution for your particular question
every time you will put in and more information, you will make your prompt more and more precise Daggubati will give you better
and better information. Now, let me ask Javed, Deputy, let's do us and this particular template
to do that job. But as an engineer or as a recruiter, I need to send an email to a job
applicant informing them that we will be proceeding with their application. Let me ask Deputy if it can give us a template
for the same as well. Let's say I am the Agile in an organization and I received this particular template
from this I.T. Will let students and I do not want to select this candidate because let's say I feel that
this person is not a cultural fit for the organization and I need to reject this particular candidate.
How can I send an email to the person saying that his profile or his application is rejected?
Let me ask the deputy and see what other result we can actually get. So if I type in query as a recruiter,
I need to send an email to a job applicant informing them that we won't be proceeding with their application.
Can you give me a template for the same? And certainly here's an email template for informing a job applicant.
The application will not be proceeding Subject Update on your job application. They are this person's name.

you can change the different details and you can use this template as it is. But let's see as a niche, not to save your employer's branding.
You feel that this is not empathetic enough since. You are rejecting a profile. It might hurt the feelings of the
other person who is going to receive this particular image. So to save yourself from hiding the feelings
of the recipient, let's say you want to make this template more empathetic. Now let me put in the problem that can you make it
more empathetic and let's see, what is the result we can get from credibility
and enter? Absolutely. Here's the revised version of the e-mail template with a more empathetic tone.
The subject is update on your job application via this applicant's name. I. This email finds you well,
and we sincerely appreciate your interest in joining our team and want to express our gratitude for the time and effort
you put in to your application for the position of this at this company Now, you can easily see the difference.
The second one is much more empathetic sample when compared to this one. Here, the email says that
I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for taking the time to apply for the position, but here if you see it says it reasons.
I really appreciate your interest in joining our team and want to express our gratitude for the time and effort
you put in your application for this. In this position like this, in this organization, you can easily see the difference
in this entire email that it is much more empathetic and it will definitely not hurt
the feelings of the person that you're going to send this email to. So it is a much more better example
when it comes to sending an email to a candidate who's rejected of whose profile is rejected.
Now, let me take another example and let me ask Chad Jeopardy to give me a simple email template
that I can use to inform these sellers of, let's say, my e-commerce company about a new update
in the business process, business processes, people and evolving. I have literature from business process
and I want to inform the sellers who are there on my e-commerce platform, how can I send them an email
informing them about that business process? Change lets us deputy if it can provide us a template
for the same or not. And here you go. Here's an e-mail template. The subject is important Update
regarding business process and the name the sellers name. Behold this email finds you well.
We are writing to inform you about an important update in our business process like this in this company,

and then all the details are clearly mentioned over here. Thank you for being a valued seller on this in this company
since earlier and you can write your name, your title and company needs. It gives us a great sample.
Now, similarly, let's say you want to translate this particular email symbol to some other language.
Next, your sellers do not understand English or do you want to change it to, let's say, German or Spanish or Hindi or some any other language?
You can easily do that with agility? Let me ask you to do that. Can you please translate the same template to German?
And you can see the activity is able to actually translate the same email template into some other language.
Here we took the example of German language. Similarly, you can take the example of any other language
that the Hindi, Spanish or any other language you cannot deputy to translate your particular
email template into that language and it will be able to do that for you. That is the power of it,
and that's precisely how we can leverage JWT when it comes to drafting emails. Now let me take one final example.
Let me, Arshad Djibouti, that I need to send a feedback email to one of my subordinates
within the organization. Let's say there's a problem with that particular person, that he's constantly missing
the deadlines. Can you provide me with a simple template? Let me put in the query and see what exactly are the results
that I can expect from Chargeability. We always have to be ensured whenever we are typing information like this
that we constructive feedback that is generated. Let's see whether activity is able to recognize
it is providing us constructive feedback or not. So as you can see, if I type in the already, I need to send a feedback email
to one of my subordinates within the organization who is constantly missing deadlines. Can you provide me with a sample template? Here you go.
Subject is feedback on meeting deadlines and here's the employee name your employee. I hope this email finds you well.
I would like to provide you with some feedback regarding meeting deadlines. Part of your role at this in this organization
as your manager, I value your contributions to the team and believe that your skills can further benefit the organization.
So this is one of the major good things which is that about Jeopardy! Or Jeopardy,
that it gives you constructive feedback by understanding the tone of your questions. So here I clearly mentioned
I need to send a feedback email to one of my subordinates, not gently, but he has the understanding
that definitely the feedback has to be in a constructive way. So here it is talking about as your manager,
I value your contribution. So it is clearly mentioning that what exactly are the good parts?
What are the best parts? And it is balancing the theme while giving a feedback to the subordinate by a particular manager.
Here it is mentioning that as a team we rely on each other to complete tasks and deliverables in a timely manner,
consistently missing deadlines can have an impact on the team's productivity and may result in delays
that can affect the overall progress of our project. That deputy is able to understand that whenever we are giving the feedback
it is extremely important that you make the other person understand the impact of why they are missing something
and once they miss it, what exactly is the impact of that on the entire team and the organization?
It is able to not just able to understand it, but also is typing the same detail in the email drop that we asked it for.
Now, let's say you find a tool, only you can judge it, but it will make it more crisp, make it more shorter, make it more empathetic,
add a particular detail. You can do all of that. You can tweak the particular template in whatever way you like.
But that's how we use Jet Deputy when it comes to drafting emails, whether you want to draft an email as a net job
that you need to send to an applicant or you are the applicant and you need to send an email to the jobs or a potential company
of a potential organization, or you are a marketing head and you need to send an email to your team who your subordinates.
Or let's say you are a subordinate and you need to escalate something to your manager. All those different types of templates
can easily be generated with the help of JWT. We have seen a few examples. Now it is time for you
to go to chat Deputy Sign up and try to create as many templates as you need. All right.

of the below comments I received on my Facebook post? Your clothes collection is amazing or I love the denim
jacket collection the most or I do not like the shoes, but the jackets look damn good or the shoes are very uncomfortable.
Love this brand. So see, these are some of the comments that I got on my Facebook post as a clothing brand.
And now I want to ask Deputy to actually give me the sentiment of the below comments. I don't want to go to
each of these comments one after the other. And I asked Chad, did we try to do the same task for me?
And here's reason. So first of all, Chad, deputy is talking about what exactly are the positive sentiments
and then what is the mixed one and what is the negative one? Let's say again, I don't want to go to all of this.
I can simply ask Chad Deputy, to summarize the sentiment. Let's say I summarize the sentiment
of the above mentioned comments
and enter. And you can see that the overall sentiment of the comments is mostly positive, with comments expressing admiration
for clothing collection, denim jacket collection in the brand as a whole. There are also mixed sentiments
where the commenters are like the jackets but dislike the shoes due to discomfort. However, there is one
negative comment warning others not to buy from the brand due to negative feedback about the shoes.
So by reading this I can simply make out that people are liking the denim jackets and other clothing product.
But people simply are not liking the shoes. And the major issues are discomfort while they're wearing the shoes.

So in this module, let's talk about the various elements of digital marketing. Now I will be making sure that
Types of Digital Marketing
all of these elements that I'm talking about here in this particular slide be done in a manner
with the help of tangibility, to make your understanding of digital marketing a lot better.


And I really will try to understand media concept through, through each activity, will understand the various
types and elements that digital marketing have. So let's start the understanding
what are the various elements. Let's just have a brief. So number one is content marketing. Then is search engine optimization.
People click social marketing, email marketing and affiliate marketing. I'm very sure
that you would have heard almost all these elements by now because at this age it's
a digital, digital age and these are pretty common topics that we hear about here and there, right?
So let's just dive deep into what these individual aspects are. So the first element
that we're talking about is content marketing. Now, content marketing is a strategic marketing approach
focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, consistent content to attract
and retain a target audience. Now, the goal of content marketing is to provide useful information.
What entertainment potential customers establishing that trust and credibility. Right?
So this is the main core component of content marketing. When you're creating content, you want your end users
gain some valuable information or may be put in entertainment movies, right? You see, you
see a lot of YouTube channels that maybe the genre would be food, maybe it would be travel,
maybe it would be comedy, maybe stand up shows, maybe a lot a lot more things maybe would be a mean channel.
So you have a lot of a lot of things that require a lot of teams to pick up from,
but you want adding that content to be viewed by a lot of people around, right? So for that digital marketing plays
a crucial role. How you place your content. Maybe it is. It depends on the timing of when you post it,
maybe it depends on a lot of different factors. Might maybe keywords that you use, the optimization of those keywords,
the search volumes of those keywords, right? So all of these things are big or very important, or maybe you would have seen reasons
that are coming up these days. The song that you pick up that is also very, very crucial in making your content visible,
your brand identity to be visible to learn what people need. So this can be done through various channels
like blog post, maybe would be articles that you write videos, maybe the podcast. No podcast, or something
that have been growing recently. A lot of people do not have that kind of time to, you know,
sit and watch a YouTube video of two people talking. So what do they do? The They just hear the podcast
that comes up, know that is also something that is really trending. Then social media entertainment.
The second element that is dead is search engine optimization. And this is my this is my favorite of the lot.
Now, search engine optimization refers to the process of improving. It is the process of improving a Web
site's visibility. If you are a brand, let's say a clothing brand, right. So you would have a website
that would be there. Now you would want anyone who would want to search that website? They'd want
maybe search your brand, right? They would just go to the search engine and type your brand. Let's say you have X, Y, Z as a brand.
So they will just type in X, Y, Z. Now what would happen is that Google would give. You results and now.
As a brand, what you want is that your website, your brand website should be placed at the top.
That is what it is now as a consumer off of internet, right? This may be a habit
or you would have known that whenever you search for anything on Google, you would not go past
the first page of Google. The first page is also a lot. And I'm talking about you won't go more than five
six top links that come up. Right? So this is the same we know from a brand's perspective
they want to target the first five websites because they know that these are the ones that would be clicked by their customers.
Not now. Search engine optimization is exactly that. What hits you
organically, your website at the top, right? So it is a process of
improving your website visibility ranking in the search engine results page, which is also known as f e r B's.
It involves optimizing the various elements of the website, including the content, the keywords, the meta
tags, the backlinks to make it more attractive to the search engines. Now the goal of fe0
that the search engine optimization is to increase the organic traffic. What does organic means?
It is non paid traffic. I'm not paying anything to Google to place my website at the top right
by improving the search engine likings for relevant keywords phrases. Now I'll give you a bit of demo
what exactly I'm talking about. Right. So let's just type in Google dot in
and we'll leave. So something that lets us see.
English of course, right? These are the things that we toggle. Let's see, English goes on me
now I click on it right now. These the websites that Google Show show me right.
So now what do I want to do as a consumer? I would click, I would click the first websites that come up. Now
You would see this is something known as sponsored that is written here, right? And these are the ones that
this particular website would have paid Google to rank them on the top right have been X amount
to make sure that their website is shown. Right. So this is not organic. This is not fee.
All right. This if e m search engine marketing read the companies b Google do rank them on the top.
But when you move down there you can see that that the websites
that do not have this one third algorithm on them. Right. These are the ones that are organically
on the top that they are not paying anything to Google basically. So this is what every brand means
for that organically without giving money to Google, if it can show up at the top. That's what everyone means. What?
So this is basically the way the procedures that end what maybe the keywords, long tailed, shorter keywords
in order, different elements, if they can get that website to rank using these strategies. Right.
How you write that this middle tags and all that, how do you use keywords? See, English
goes online to English course and online, all three of you. It's now how much they have placed those keywords,
how would they have clubbed it together. So all that matters. So this is search engine optimization.
Then if people click, not people click is an online advertising more linguistic advertise
pay a fee each time the ad is clean, so it is typically used in search engine advertising.
Then they advertise it based on the keywords relevant to the target audience. Real time bidding
happens in the scenario, like when a user So just for a keyword, the search engine displays
relevant ads and advertisers pay for each click. The ad receives no pay per click.
Campaigns can be highly targeted and along the advertisers to reach a specific audience
and measure the effectiveness of DID ads. Then it's social media marketing. So social media
involved social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and lot more. A lot of things ding are coming up these
days, right? All of these are pleasant to promote what the product, the service or thereby
increase the brand visibility. So it involves creating and creating various content. Now, if you would have seen
a lot of a lot of brands these days use use the current buzzwords, red buzz news
that are coming up to make a meme out of it and integrate into their channel. You can see a lot of different brands
have this online. Great. So the mean marketing has has increased quite a lot.
Right? So video what what would happen now? The social media marketers aims
to increase the brand awareness drive the website traffic. They want to create that funnel
in which top of the funnel and you get more and more people to just click on. That was first betrayed.
The first phase in which the consumer interacts with the brand right? Generate the leads and foster
that consumer loyalty by leveraging the wide user base that is presently online.
Digital space Is this space in which you would not have to know the competition is a lot more,
but you really do not have to pay a lot of money to get in that space. If you know your content unique,
it stands out, it is not repetitive, then you have a chance to stand out. Right?
So this is about social media marketing. Then another thing that that all the marketers these days, all the brands these days
focus on is called email marketing. Now, email marketing is the digital marketing strategy
that involves sending targeted emails. Now you've seen most of your emails that you received on a very specific trip
are they're very tailor made for you. It seems as if that they know about your life
and they have below me that thing. Maybe you're searching some clothes online. They know that route.
You'll be sure to do it on any number of things. And you also this even targeted emails regarding that think, hey,
X, Y, z you were looking for for the brand, you're looking for this snake. Why you do and why did you the lifted in the card
so all these doctors would be please read all these e-mails. Getting e-mails would be there for you.
So all this is comes under the targeted strategy that these brands don't play. So it is commonly used to communicate
with the customers, promote the services or provide updates or newsletters that customer.
Now, effective email marketing involves segmenting the audience, crafting that compelling email contain
the words that you now I know to show you how to write using tangibility can make it much more innovative.
But at the end, the the main core of the message that is what you have to provide, like personalizing those messages
for delivery and engagement. It can be efficient, cost effective way to reach out at the specific audience
that is relevant and drive those convergence. So these these are the major elements that are there in email marketing.
The end part is the affiliate marketing now, So it's a performance based marketing,
it's a model where many individuals earn a commission by promoting and driving feels of a company or the product.
So it's like a team based in order to better bring more news. So all this comes and it the the affiliate marketing strategies right
so if lead typically receives a unique tracking link so you can promote the product various channels using the website
blog social media but using so it's in one and it's not just the brand

So it's like a chain, it's like a pyramid model niche. It keeps on going and going
and there's no stop to it. So that's affiliate marketing. Now let's try to understand
Understanding Market Segmentation using ChatGPT
the first element that is market segmentation. Now how are really good rechargeable
that I'll take the example of for a hypothetical situation. Let's say
that I have clue about what digital marketing is. Now I want to start a company of brand
clothing brand probably, let's say traditional some. What about traditional Indian red? Now I want
to understand the key principles of digital marketing and how I can enhance my brand,
how can explore my brand, how can I find more things that in our digital we would catch
catch up, right? Which what would that mean? That Would mean that my brand would grow organically
in a digital space. Now I would heavily need digital marketing because I'm not going and setting up a store.
Or maybe I want to. Then I can just ask him what are the things that are required? But in a nutshell,
I would want to launch my brand online and I would have a lot of elements in work
that the questions I would be asking is about about my brand. Okay, so let's get started.
So let's start with a. Fresh business So this is the place we know now.
Let me type in my first query. So I would say suggest me means for a clothing brand
that focuses on traditional Indian, that know the way you structure your question is also very important.
No, I'm asking to just meaning sort the clothing brand that focuses on tradition and invest.
No, I would additionally add to this is that.
I make sure it stands
out in the digital space.
Right? So now the first born, the diapers, the needs for the clothing brand that focuses
on the traditional Indian bed, make sure that it stands out in the digital space. Now I want
to the way you structured your product is also very. Essential, right Now.
I have focused here on traditional Indian wear and clothing brand, right? So it knows what it is.
Then I've additionally added that make sure it stands out in the digital space, right?
So let's see what it suggests.
Right? So now I have made sure that it stands out in their digital space. So it is great
giving me some of the other options. Right? So it is going to be of such words
that I can name as my brand, right? So it is Indian law here. It is straight. So it knows that
India's has a bit of heritage in water, that it has added that thing. So it has that data in wallet,
as I mentioned, that it has been trained on a lot of data till September 2021. So it knows what exactly
Indian tradition means, Right. So it has that Sanskrit, this style, let's say, Indian order culture, elegance, vintage bazaar.
So Bazaar is a very Hindi word, right? So it has included that thing to give me a good,
you know, structure to the, to the name that I want to give it to, to the brand that I'm launching. Right.
So it also knows that in India at this time is a state that has a lot of history
in world in it, Right. So it has also given me that I just tend royals. It is Alt.Latino,
but something of that sort. So it is giving me a various you know, I get to choose a trade
or I can just make I can also in addition, if I do not like this, I can just add in.
Tell me more his story
words, words that I can choose
from you. So I am just giving the. Okay, yeah.
So now it has given me. So I will ask you to give me more historic words that I cannot do it right now.
It has given me a lot of words that are the right historic words. My Dad's that Nawab, that gives them
the elegance to the Indian heritage. Right? It would it would add in to that. So I can use these words in the names
that it has been suggested. Now I can add three they. Add
these names and suggest me
the brand names and that I can take.
So I have added this. Now just say that now exactly what happened.
Great. So it added the second prompt right now. As I told before, that it has the memory of its own right.
So the second poem that I did, my Agent Ortiz included in the first one, and it has added those words
Maharaja Nawab, Mughal, Rajput Zari, so it has added this words
and made me made an emotive. Now I can choose it in a much better way. So this is the level of customization
that I can give you. Now. You don't need to think about four days in this world to name a brand.
You can get it from here, you can customize it over here. That's the beauty of.
Right. Now. In addition to this, if I am very nice person and I just want
let's say my favorite letter is right and I want to keep my brand's name
from the letter. So what I do, I just ask it, you can use this meaning that started in the letter. I really frankly.
So let's see what what comes up.
Right. So now it has given me words that that are that starts from the letter R
in an Indian historic manner. Right. So I don't need type in again that okay tell me in the traditional manner
in Indian heritage minded it is something it would understand and so that's that's what I'm talking about
when it has memory of its own, not if the name is sorted out. Okay, let's say I've chosen one word, right.
So if I have, let's say just taken up one random raster by left to see that I've been posted by.
So I would add this down a few catchy taglines for the brand. Great. So let's see what it comes up with.
So it has given me a lot of different a lot of it I probably would end up if if my vocabulary is not good
I'm Lehman digital marketing. I would not understand the way things the taglines work, right?
I mean, not that creative, but I don't. Taglines mean you have to hide high ed party individual to do that, right?
So it cuts down on the cost that is required to do for you to just start off video brand.
Now it has given me fabulous, fabulous. Like embrace the color of tradition where heritage meets fashion.
What a fabulous tagline. It helps to meet fashion and really your ethnic jump, right?
So all these different types of taglines I did not choose it from. You know, if I want to add more customization
in this as well, I can do that of course. So now my brand title is fixed, my brand name is fixed on brand type
tagline is fixed. Now what next to do right now? The next thing is to find out your TV,
and that is total addressable market. So in general, just asked what would be the target
audience online considering the brand only sells through the online websites and this to the Indian market, right?
So now I don't have to think that, okay, if the European market or maybe the North American market, maybe an Australian market
want to cover it up, I am just focused on selling this this through an online website in India.
So what would be the target audience rate and considering I'd say starting group then. So let's see, what would
tangibly gives us. Yeah. So as we can see that
Chowdhury has given me that considering that your brand said exclusively through the online websites and caters
specifically to the Indian the target audience would be urban Indians. Number of white have given me the reason.
As to. Individuals residing in urban areas would have access to the internet and in producing
those traditional Indian. Online. Fashion conscious Indians, people who would actively follow fashion
to Indian seek stylish and contemporary Indian clothing options. Okay. One thing that I have not added in my prompt
is that how do I want my brand to be? What is it like a modern ethnic or is it like a traditional,
broadly historical, purely the one that does not include a lot of fancy stuff?
You would have the basic one right? So that have not added in the beginning. If I would have had it,
it would have given you much more niche wanted. So exactly how you structured your question also resembles
to how you want your brand to be right. So millennials and Gen Z, so younger generations
who are tech savvy, digitally connected and open to exploiting online or shopping experiences, right?
So that is would be the ones who who would want to buy for India because if they want it,
they can get it for someone who is residing the families inside India. So can get it for them now.
So all these flashy bloggers, influencers, so you would know you get a fair bit of idea.
You of course have to do your own research on how selling how you're not, but it would give you the idea to start from right now.
If I know now, if I wanted to start online, can I get a two tier two tier each of these directly or should I focus
heavily on tier one first get most of us in India one rate. So that is the idea that it would give,
which is fabulous. So in this module, let's talk about social media marketing.


Social Media Marketing
Let's look at the different elements of social media that are popular these days. Be Facebook Meta or Instagram, be it,
let's say Pinterest. We need things that are heavily used by the consumers.
So let's focus on how to market the product this right? So let's just go in and type in articles
from in that regard. So now let me ask you, what are the ways to generate
the most leads and impressions on Facebook social media platform right.
I should add for my brand.
Let's see what what gives. Us
know if. I have to ask the judge who will be the most leads in information. So it will give me
the various strategies that I incorporate to generate leads and impressions. So they have given me. The answer to.
Generate leads and impression on Facebook Social Media Platform. Here's some effective strategies
you can implement make compelling content, create engaging and visually appealing audience. So if
if my is traditional bed, which it has given me high quality
videos, informative Wall Street unique features. And so it also talks about how to highlight
the unique features. Let's see if I'm giving an it said setting aside that it can be different
different type of can be a nasty sighting date. It can be. A variety of studies. And notice this idea explored. But though
the reason why this would give me this kind of thing is that I would want to highlight it in
the description. If I'm giving. If I'm posting. Let's say a post about this idea that that. My brand needs.
So I would give them, okay, this is the craftsmanship that is required is handmade. It has various elements to it.
The color is unique in that regard. So all these appealing things,
the features, the cultural significance and how they started, what is historic in that tradition
when they were used to wear it in the past in the street. So the storyline should be compelling enough.
So that is it is telling me then targeted advertising utilized the Facebook.
It was targeting options to reach a specific audience. Define the target demographic
on your location. Is it not understanding? Will it be targeted in your campaigns?
If you want a specific product line of your brand to be on on one specific demography,
let's say a beat people in the range of 60 to 70, you would want to know
their interest rate. You would want know what they would like, what that generation would look like, what would be the significance of that.
And and, you know, fluster to that that needs because at the consumer comes
the core of the business that you're doing right now, running the Facebook ads. Now if I do not ask if that give me the
the vs organic if would have us would have not given me the ads option in which I would have to spend money.
Right. So you have to be very careful in writing these things. It is good that I know that Facebook now.
I can I can be for the ads to be displayed. Right. I could spend my marketing budget
in that in that regard. Then influence the collaborate that I can you know the law abiding influencers these days.
I could just partner with them, collaborate with them on this regard, give them maybe a free freebies of some sort
and get them on board with collaborating some of the other conditions to basically have that out.
Delete the brands of the needs, the brands, visibility to the audience that they would have created,
the influencers would have. So that would be the no contest in giveaways like videos behind the scenes.
So these are the things you can work on Facebook groups in community, you being a group
and be a part of a group that deals in that genre of things. Right then Testimonials.
These are various. The reviews that you post on or on your website, right? You building a website
or you building your your feedback channel to me. So you would want your testimony to the customer experiences
to be displayed for any new person. If you go rate, let's see if you are exploring that. See even a restaurant. Great.
If you go, you read the reviews. Is it good enough? Maybe on speaking maybe once in that to maybe on Google Maps you would know.
You would want to know what the reviews are like, so then you would want to engage with the followers retargeting.
You implement the fix Facebook fixes on you on your website to track their, you know, whatever
they have mentioned here, I can cross question them. What does this mean? How does to implement this?
How to start with Facebook groups in communities, how to engage more effectively with followers?
Give me the step by step analysis. I can absolutely ask you would be anything and everything that I want to make my brand visible.
That's the. Thing. So now if I want to optimize
a lot of things, let's just type in one query, The one prompt that lists out the ways
to optimize the clothing brands. Facebook page. One of the elements that leads would have a Facebook page.
Would have a date. So let's see what would do the answers. Okay, so what it is displaying
means that to optimize the clothing brands Facebook page had some guys started using the best practices,
complete page information, and show that all the necessary information about your clothing brand is filled out
completely inaccurate. This includes your brand name, contact details, website
links, business size in a compelling and a concise description of your brand. Then it would be the covered
for to end profile. So it's giving me all step by step things that after the break
consistent branding compelling about about section. The about section in the page
should be crafted in using about how clearly communities the brand's story
mission and unique thing. But so if for a layman this turns a very fancy terms to look at but
at the end, if you want to gain that knowledge and want to implement it, I may be or let's say a software developer,
but I would not know much about how the digital marketing space works. I would have to hire the person
and this is giving me all that in the most of it. I and see I wouldn't say that it can replace a digital marketer,
which would still give you a sense of things, what you need to work on behalf of, what you need to.
Work on, right? So If you are starting out right, everybody these days
maybe want to be an entrepreneur. So if you want to do that thing, if you want to go in that regard, this is the perfect way
to get to know things. It can be. I'm not saying it is actually. I'm not saying 100% correct.
I'm saying that most of the things that you would want, you would get it over here if people if you have to,
of course, fact check it and cross verified a lot of things, But 80% of your job
would be if you if you want to apply the produce principle, the 20% things that would give you 80% of
this is that 20% that you want to focus on. Right. So it would give you that that thing,
anything that would give you maximum output. So this is how you would want to ask it.
Get that query straight, get that thing straight. What you want for your particular brand right now.
Again, also asking that what are the most effectively is it we talked about the Facebook ads that you displayed me
Now, if I want to ask it in that regard, what are the most effective ways to run targeted
Facebook ads for marketing of a clothing brand? And what would it give me? Great. It would give. Me that
define the target audience. You Know your dog? What would your target audience would be then?
Custom audience How How would do the location on the targeting would be great.
I'd view the visuals, compelling ads and call to actions how to include those
A call to Action Image testing in testing. As we talk about in the email marketing section,
I'll talk about what these are basically a given that you experiment in the various art variations
that I would do, you know, rule out date. So I didn't just have any new days and then spending my marketing money.
In a. Fully fledged campaign. I can just image I can just tested out if it is working or not, but is looking.
And I don't it's not I so something that's that then optimization analysis you know
continuously monitoring the performance of the Facebook ads then tracking key metrics like reach engagement
through rhythm these conversions all that things can be done for, for the brand that I'm targeting. So now what would happen
if I want to about about led to Instagram and you would have a lot of hashtags that I do right.
So if I want to outreach my brand to the level image or a scale invisible,
every third person me hold off the name of my brand. So hashtags would be a perfect way
to start with that means. Hashtags, right? So since it's it cannot, it can give me real ideas, by the way.
So you can also do something on that regard. But if I want to add the search volume hashtags,
that'd be great for a clothing brand to. Enhance my old region on another social media
platform called Instagram. So let me see what would it gives me right?
So it knows that what would be the most trending? So what is search volume? So it's basically
the thing that the most people searched on a search. Engine, right? So that volume,
how much people are searching that fashion is number one. The keyword fashion comes in number one.
So these are the things that I want to include in my brand
when I'm going to when I'm posting out of an insta post, a Facebook on something
or that on a social media platform, I would warn that these hashtags are there in that was now
this would give me a wider right you know consumer base on or maybe the visibility.
A lot of people would probably see that because of the hashtag themes. So this is why it is using hashtags.
I don't know I would want to get my brand
if I want to make content calendar, I would have to post on these social media platforms.
So maybe I'll make a 30 day calendar, maybe only 15 the calendar. So I want to know what
what are the various captions I can put in those particular post on average, let's say
15 days from now and going to post about, let's see, oh, fashion
that I'm going to introduce, right. A new product line that I'm going to use. So how would that look that I just ask you,
can you suggest some mind blowing captions? What can you think post on Instagram regarding that tradition bed nights.
So it would give me the various options that I can use. Now what I would do is I would look these.
I would ask them to generate more. I would look at these, I'll open up my Excel, I'll just,
you know, and I don't down and make a calendar out of my pocket 1/16, August 15th of August,
17th of August, these other things, this is what I'm going to post. This is the caption of that was so
this is how you make a point then candidate is basically if you want to be a content creator or if you want to, you know, optimize
how you want to, you know, do post on social media. This is the perfect way. You can just get those ideas,
get started with it. It may also be a scenario in which you want to create a campaign that can be a marketing plan
for the clothing for the upcoming new year. So New Year is like a festive season. So the rush, the
the number of orders you would be getting of the brand would be a lot more. Right? So festive season get a lot more orders.
Right. You have to be prepared for that as well. Right. So and also how the digital marketing plan
would be for your brand. Right. So if I want to ask you, create a digital marketing plan for my clothing brand for the. Upcoming new year.
So this would give me an idea of what needs to be done way before. New Year comes me.
So it gives me that, okay, I need to engage with my audience
in marketing. 13 Optimization customer is you. These are things that I need to focus on. Me.
So it gives you this is the planner and you do what good. I know I can be much more mission. Ask them much more different questions
regarding to what they have or I can just build it up from it how I want to build it.
Now, since our target audience is in India, we mentioned that the demography that the
the the scheme that will be targeting is is in India. So
the the festivals festival in India let's say just to get I guess would be either
Eve or Diwali or, or a lot of different festivals that come up. Right. So let's just take
an example of the valley and the city and I think that you related to this and what regular customers of developments
that I bought my traditional very now I want to also because I want to retain those customers date
I want them to keep shopping from my brand so I would want them to know this is what do I do please before that.
Make it gives. It makes me ladies to customers as well if you know what that customer.
And so it would give me a visiting later on. It's so necessary to be a valued customer.
And on this Joyce of the Valley, we wanted to make take a moment to express a heartfelt beatitude
for the continued support of us and as the as the Festival of Lights, your loyalty in the Cloud clothing brand.
And you can deliver this because the customers like you that we're inspired to
continuously innovate and strive for excellence. Now what this is doing is
also giving a feedback of digital marketing in the state. It would also define the way
the customer perceives us. If you receive a tailor made, let's say a tailor made gratitude, humiliated
for being a regular customer, that would also give you that kind of one between the brand and the consumer.
And that's exactly what what it needs to be. So now it has me. Now if I want to I don't want this.
I want something else I don't want seem to be thin. I can regenerate in sports right now.
This is a fairly shorter product, but you can also add customizations. Do it right. You can
in fact, you can customization what each if you starting out, you would have a lot left
lesser customers that you need. And so you can also have much more tailor made gratitude letters for them
If you know how they did what I did fashion sense then this can. Be done this way. Right?
So if I had easily sports, I would get okay. So I could view the one that is way. So if to buy to.
It it's using I can go back. I see the first response. The second response. Right.
So this is what we see raining and industrial dividing. So all these things can be done.
On Djibouti, you would not need to hired an external person to consider this as
a system that would help you. As as. A bridge to market it. Right.
Okay. In this module, let's try to understand what are the various ways in which we can implement email marketing
using tangible DNA for exactly the same clothing brand. So let's just type in our prompt.
For. Suggesting me ways to create an email marketing campaign for.
My clothing brand. Known as Element. I would not know what email marketing is, right?
So think in that regard that I would have to give in. It's basically like how a Beyonce ABC
if I'm talking about me learning email marketing. So it will give me that. Exactly right.
It would give me. Okay the steps. I did not ask for steps,
but it is telling me, okay, throw it some steps to create an email marketing campaign. Define Your campaign goals.
Where do I want from your domain? The objectives of email marketing campaigns. So the examples could be promoting
a new collection, announcing a sale or especially offered the with the inactive subscribers.
Right. So this giving me all sort of these thoughts of how to think regarding email marketing right now build
email is not ensure that you have a well-maintained segmented email this gap to the email addresses
through your website. Social media installed sign ups and touch points. Right? So it is giving me okay know
if I would not know what that point is, I would just ask what doesn't have points. So it would give me the first element
that a customer interacts with regarding your brand is a touch point. Maybe click on that so that that
that is what it is. It's there directly to it. Now it is a username in marketing so it's not selector label
marketing service provider that fits in your needs and budgets popularized me. It gives me exact brands alternate
no note that these may be outdated because the knowledge that it has is still 2021.
I know that used MailChimp is still very popular, but in this regard when it
is giving you options about some things that it gets from the internet,
you have to cross verify. So I would not really give this much more emphasis.
However, I know as a marketer that MailChimp is very popular even for setting up your email campaigns
in testing, you know, but you have to do your research on what these elements are, but it is giving you how to search
email marketing service, providing new insights with which many of these are good. You do it in research time,
then craft a compelling subject line. Now this can be done by tangible. You can ask you to build.
A. Compelling subject line for, for, or let's say, any anything, any person, any subject lines that you want.
If you are rolling out an offer, especially offered on the occasion or different occasions that come on, they love their
they want something. Else. In addition, something of that sort. Right angle
Define engaging email partner. You use a visually appealing image template
using your brand tactics, incorporate high quality images, clear CDs, and a call to action buttons.
Where do they click to get into the funnel? Right? You want to be a marketing funnel. How do you do that?
So you make sure that everybody comes to your top of the funnel, right? So all the links should be
redirected to a website or somewhere in which it has the journey and will display it.
Then the compelling content create, engaging and, informative content that adds value to your subscribers
in book, showcase new collections, providing the styling tips and all that great creating call to actions.
Amy Testing. We talked about experiment with different elements. Subject line which was
blended through. It would save you a lot of money based variations to see what resonates
then automation margin analysis. You can do it about that. Great. So this is how you would build up
your email marketing campaign in a step by step manner. Now let's just I call this out some eye catching subject line
to grab customers attention. For my brand, right?
So if I give them, let's say, what comes up, let's see. Great exclusive. Offer inside.
Now these are the things that you normally see as well, right? So now this is not you would not have to go in search it.
Look, you wonder what are my competitors doing? What should I how should I look about it? How should I set up my marketing campaigns? Right.
So now it has given me the subject lines to grab those attention as well. Right. Limited time. Only you can have a great sort of
have added eye catching statement the way here. So this is a keyword in the prompt that I'm providing it
that it has to something that is very catchy. Because each week in in.
A normal business it is only one or 2% that Your Eminence would be even open
for that marketing. So it has to be very, very catchy in terms of good, in terms of the subject lines. Right.
So you can give it give it a look on which one is it seems more catchy. You can add that in your media gym
in your debut Best thing in this new note, if it works. So this is how you can add things.
Now, this is which everybody is very good at and it can add a lot more things, right? So when are do we what we can do
is that let's just give it a scenario. It could you write a good. Email. To persuade a potential customer
is interested in buying, let's say sorry in a funky way, not only one that customer
who probably has a Saudi in their car and they would sign up in the website said they would have something in the card
that you can track, right? So you could write a cool email to persuade the customer
who is interested in buying this uniform. You know, they just see what it gives. It's a very, very good structured
question prompt right now. It would give you a very you know, is number
one thing is talking about India so it starts with Namaste State or whatever. So what resonates more
you would like to know and we hope this image to find you in high spirits and this for embracing your unique style.
Right? We couldn't help but notice your interest in Saudis. Now you will also add that
that customers who are interested in buying Saudi and has the Saudi in their card,
maybe you can add it in the brackets. And who understands that in this of that of the email that it is there
no subject unleashes so I Saudi swag get funky with my collection so it gives a a variety different
subject lines that that are really. Got to you right. So you can build all that from here right again
you would not need another digital marketing to do that you don't have to pay anyone else. It just does it for you.
So another variation that we can think of is that if you would write a cool email formatting within brand targeting
and elderly people right now, they would not want that kind of fun. Keeping that. Society swag. And all that was mentioned in the. Of email. So it would give me that timeless elegance for your young at heart. Discover the collection. Right? So it wants to make the elderly feel that you're young. It doesn't matter if you the numbers since this young at heart right so it has given me that is such a beautiful so the fantastic thing to do right so this is the potential that tangibility has. It can structure your things in such a way that could also give you a very, very good look, your brand, a very, very good look. Right. You can develop your brand identity.


Through the. To through you. This is what this whole crux is about, who does how you can optimize.
 Now, this is the moment in which you really want your brand to go of design. You have to have that blitzkrieg. 
 You have to add that little analogy of giving them, giving it a try, giving judge you try giving digital marketing the way you can collaborate with the brand, 
 right? That is very, very important right there has given me this what for the elderly as well So you have a lot of variations in input. 
 Absolutely. Every demographic you want, you're going to have it done through activity. Now let's try to focus on the customer feedback. 
 So if I. Have a brand now, I would want the customers to. Give. Me positive or negative feedback of how my show me the reality of how my brand is is behaving. 
 How does it look like to do a normal customer to a custom unbiased customer rate? So how does it look like right? 
 So you would understand to generate these customer feedback forms, understand what goes in to customer feedback. 
 Now let's just type in upfront.
So the first problem that I would be asking is what are the different ways to take a customer feedback on a product they bought from our site?
Now remember that I am a layman in terms of digital marketing.
I have absolutely no clue what is happening in digital marketing domain.
So what would I need?
I would want tangible do do tell me that what are the different ways I can get that customer feedback.
Right.
From the products that they have bought online?
Right.
So let's look at so the online survey now send out the online surveys to customers after they have made up by dates.
You use tools like SurveyMonkey or Google Forms.
Again, do not look at this part because this may be outdated.
You can do your research on the tools that are there.
They then basically setting up a one online survey.
Great.
Number two is the email request and reach out to the customers by email and request the feedback.
Then it would be the product review.
How do you have your product review done?
Then it would be the feedback from my thank you pages and the social media Listening How to monitor your Social media Channels Comments, direct messages.
You know you need to reply to that.
If someone is put in your proposal and is mentioned that this is the grievances that they had immediately posted, posted that you have muted down your query, please share your or the number with us.
We'll get back to you as soon as possible, then follow back.
That's how you build a good been a good feedback, customer feedback, right then user testing.
You know how to conduct user testing sessions when you invite your customers to try out different products or features and feedback on the experiences.
So that is what this is about right now that I know look at, these are the various ways in which I can gather that feedback from the customer and I would want them to create me one.
Right?
So I've added create a customer feedback form for the customers who have bought the products from my website.
How would you build that?
So this would give me the exact idea how to do that.
Right now we greatly value your feedback.
Appreciate your taking time to share thoughts on the products or the information.
This is what we would be providing them with this then.
Product feedback.
How do you like it?
Maybe I would want them to add new yes or.
No.
Or maybe ratings from 1 to 5.
So I can do that.
But different visa parameters BE What are you satisfied with?
The customer's always throughout the process, the customer supporting this promptly to your inquiries all concerned.
Now just imagine that when you're starting out your company, when you're starting out the company from the base, you don't have a lot of capital anymore to hire people, right?
This becomes your ultimate guide.
This becomes your writing a tool that would help you.
That is what free rate.
To use this.
Now, this is much more, as you can see, that this is much more qualitative in the rate.
You do not have a reading skill involved in it.
Now what if I just want them to?
I want to make new rating scale has been great with the the more quantitative questions, then quantitative questions.
Then I would add, can you use more quantitative questions in the above form?
Because I want to quantify the design side.
Now, at the end, I would have to analyze the data we're in, which I feel is my brand lagging behind rate based on the customers that that that are their rate.
So in this I will certainly here's the updated form now you also get one being the dissatisfied the mean the.
Highest at this way.
I can ask it to add more questions also it can try it out.

It is not much more accurate in that regard, but yeah, it certainly does the work rate.
Now this.
Is a much more.
Activity of possibly utilizing the previous one.
So this one looks much more clear in that regard.
Okay.
Now if I.
Want them to add more questions to it, they will do that.
Now it has known that I want it in a table format.
It would again go back and just make it in a table format.
I do not have to import that, give it entity one format it already knows now.
Right now if I have to change that, then I have to give it up from the Christine's.
This.
How do you know?
Overall shopping experience, user experience, customer services, recommendations, rate.
So all these things, including customer feedback.
Let us discuss about applications of chargeability for financial services so we can use in various financials.
Okay, that activity we can use for any service that financial services we are going to get.
But in this we are going to discuss about personal finance management, we are going to discuss about investment strategies and portfolio management, and then we are going to discuss about retirement planning, pension schemes and we are going to discuss about banking sector next taxation and accounting practices and chargeability in credit score and credit management.
So we'll see one by one.
This is the chargeability how look indi you are desktop correct.
So I already told you this chargeability is like communication or how we are going to communicate with the other person.
See, just I will do the input.
Yes.
Hi.
So that IGP is going to response.
Hello again us is today.
So here we can give what our discussions are.
They are whatever the questions we need to ask for.
Chargeability we can ask you and it will like it next format.
It is going to give the answers.
So we will start with the our personal finance management.
So will ask first question how can I balance my short term and long term financial goal?
So this is very, very important for individuals, correct?
So we need to make it a goal like first short term and long term.
So if you are earning ₹10,000 as a salary, it is an example.
Okay.
So in that 10,000, how I can make short term financial goal and how can I make my long term financial goal So short term goals, for example, this month, what are the household expenses are There are this month I need to pay my son's educational fees or tuition fees or whatever the dancing class are, whatever the other expenses are that are my short term goals.
If I come for a long term goal for long term goals, like I need to purchase one motor vehicle or I need to purchase a car, I don't need to purchase one land and building so that are my long goals.
Correct.
So how we need to plan.
So yeah, some solutions are there, so we'll see one by one.
So balancing short term and long term financial goals is an important part of financial planning.
So we need to segregate our first planning.
So which are our short term goals?
Are, are our long term goal.
So after that you need to plan.
Okay.
So first set clear financial goals.
So financial is nothing but what is we need to achieve or what I need to get?
That is our goal.
Correct?
So if I want to purchase like after two years, so that is my goal.
I need to purchase a bike that is long term.
Short term, I need to pay my son's educational that is this short term.
So first we need to set a clear financial goals.
That is our first step.
Second, prioritize your goals.
So in short term, our little you like pay the rent or pay the electricity bill or since educational fees or whatever.
They also expenses are there or we need to purchase some clothes.
Correct.
So in that we need to set a priority which is very necessity.
US are which is very priority.
Is that okay.
Which are least priority.
Is that so.
According to that we need to plan so first 1000.
Okay.
We need to pay rent.
Correct.
So that is our first priority.
Second one, we need to pay electricity bill.
And the third one is we need to pay since educational tuition fees.
Correct.
That is also very priority are high priority.
So like that we need to make the priority, which is a second third priorities are that we need to set the priorities according to our goal.
And when it comes to long term, I need to participate after two years, correct.
So far that also I need to save some money.
For example, 10,000, at least 10% of the value that is ₹1,000 every month.
I need to save for my future goal after, my long term good.
That is okay.
We need to plan next, create our budget so you know the meaning of budget, right?
So budget is nothing but it is the estimation of future inflow and outflow of cash.
So how much revenue or how much profit do you are going to get for that particular month or particular year?
And how much I need to spend that is what is the expected expenses for that particular month are for the particular year so that you need to create a budget for forever personal finance and the fourth one, build an emergency fund.
So all your companies also, they are going to keep the reservations that is resource and surplus, correct?
So why they're going to keep the reserves So we can't predict the future like how the COVID hit.
Correct.
So all the finance it may be for personal finance, our companies, everyone that are affected with this COVID, correct.
In that scenario, we required some reserves.
Okay.
So that is the reason as an individual, as a person, we need to make a reserve for our future.
Okay?
Whatever the uncertainties are there.
So whatever the emergencies will be there.
So for that, we need to create some money next save for retirement.
Okay.
For example.
No, I'm 28 years.
Okay, so at what age I can work up to 58 or 68.
Correct.
So after 60 it what is my financial plans that is a big question.
Correct.
So if you are going to earn now, yes, you are going to spend after 60 years, who is going to spend or who is going to give money?
Correct.
So for that, we need to plan for our retirement also.
So in our retirement, how we need to look.
So consider a financial planner.
Okay, So discharge equity work as a financial planner.
Okay, if you can ask a question.
So I'm going to just I will type a question here.
I am earning.
Of.
₹10,000 Parliament.
How can they land for it here?
So if you ask this question, so Chargeability will give you suggestions.
So according to your work, whatever the earnings are that so you can ask as an adviser like charge pretty well Duty advisory services.
Okay, how you need to do oral, you need to budget, how much you need to self.
So with this then those are earnings.
So all you need to plan are what are the steps you need to follow to achieve your goals are need to balance your budget with that financial year.
So that will use these steps if you hold debt or if you are disheartened borrowings, long term borrowings are debts are there.
So that will give all sort of suggestions or advisory functions by discharge equity.
So whatever the equations that you have, you can ask that will gives the suggestions like Jeopardy will work as it advisory services.
The next question I'm going to ask what are some strategies for reducing my expenses and increasing my income?
So if I want to increase my earnings or if I need to increase my income, okay, so what are these strategies?
Are there?
So reducing expenses and increasing income are two key strategies.
So ultimately we need to reduce our expenses, correct?
So if we reduce our expenses, then we can increase our whatever the incomes, for example, I think as the last example, 10,000 is my salary.
So in that and those are only I need to save more money.
So what are the strategies I need to do or what are the ways are so in that first one, create a budget, reduce housing cost.
So that is unnecessary expenses.
Sometimes What you are going to do, it is not required some extent, it is not required.
But also what we are going to do, we are going to invest my money or our money in that particular thing.
It may be purchasing of exquisite equipment or purchasing of luxury furniture or whatever the other things are that unnecessarily we are going invest our money so that we can reduce that is in control of our and only that is in the controllable, correct.
So on that time we can reduce the so we can increase our income or increase our earnings or savings.
Correct.
So that is one strategy.
Next, cut back on transportation cost, unnecessary traveling if required, then only if you are going to go to that place way.
Sometimes what we are going to do?
Unnecessary.
We are going to spend on transportation.
If you are using public service or your own transportation for own transportation.
Also, we need to spend on fuel and other things.
Correct.
And public transportation.
Also, we need to pay for whatever the fare charges are there that we need to pay and we are going to spend money, correct.
So we can reduce in this way also that is cut back on transportation cost are if it is necessary.
Instead of using your personal vehicles, we can use public transportation also.
So, for example, from airplanes to that place, if I want to go with my personal vehicle, then I need to spend ₹1,000 for the same place to that place.
If I use this public transportation, then I can spend only under of this.
So in this we can say ₹9, Correct.
So that is one strategy to reduce next.
Shop.
Smarter.
Next cut back on eating out.
So whatever the outside food, reduce entertainment expenses.
So whatever the entertainment we are going to spend right is on that.
So these are the fuel reducing expenses that the discharge is going to suggest.
Next, what are the activities are just for increasing our incomes with this reducing expenses?
Also, we can save money.
Other than that, how we can increase our income.
So first one, get higher paying jobs.
So we need to check which are the jobs, are given more salary for our work and next start is out as told that, consider starting a part time business or freelancing to earn additional income whenever the free times is there under time.
Whatever the feasible work or whatever the what we can do are, we are good in that work.
So in that time we can do this freelancing, rent out space or monetize.
You are all these sell items no longer needed.
So these are a few strategies we can do and we can increase our income.
So these are really suggestions given by the charge Deputy for how to reduce our expenses and increase our incomes.
Next, how can I prioritize and manage my debt effectively by everyone having this debt correct?
So either credit cards or loans, personal loan, educational loan or housing loan we are going to go through with loans only are.
That's correct.
So we can maintain effectively.
So there are fewer suggestions given by Chargeability.
So first one, list all your debts.
So first we need to list the debts that is which are all the loan are which already credit outtake and.
So first we need to make the list.
Second prioritize ever debt.
If for example, I have a personal loan so first we need to look at the interest rate.
Correct.
So if I want to go to taking a loan, okay, for whatever the reason.
Okay.
So for that, we need to check the interest rate as a common public, we are going to do correct.
So if, for example, SBI is offering the loan, HDFC offering loan or any other banks that are going to offer loan, Correct.
So first we are going to check which bank is going to offer, how much interest rates are, which is offering for least rate of interest.
Correct.
We are going to check and reduce charging less processing charges, everything we need to check.
Correct.
So You're also dischargeable.
It is given the same strategy and situation.
So first, we need to prioritize the debts based on the interest rate and the balances.
Correct.
So we need to check these.
We generally list interest rates.
Are that okay?
According to that, we need to prioritize and next make a plan, develop a plan for paying off your debt.
So after that, we need to prioritize our we need to make a plan of paying their debts or we need to redeem the debt repayment of debt.
Next, negotiate with creditors.
So creditors is nothing but one gives the money are ones who do you want The products or services on the basis of credit creditors is nothing but for whom.
We will say to others are opposed to other party.
That is the creditors.
So these creditors may be your banker or any financial institution or private party.
Okay, So we need to negotiate with them.
Okay.
If, for example, if the private person, if they are going to offer a loan for 10%, we are not going to accept for 10%.
Correct.
So we need to negotiate at least 48%.
That is need negotiate, avoid taking on new debt.
So simply, if you required money, go for a loan that is also borrowed, I would increase our income.
So earlier also we have discussed no So in free time we can do freelancing or whichever is mainly good or reasonable salary for you are work that kind of income.
We need to get create a budget, seek professional help.
So if you are struggling to manage our debt, consider help from financial adviser or credit counselor.
So whatever the suggestions given by chargeability after that, also very good.
Some other suggestions.
Then you can go over to the advisory functions.
All your bankers are commercial banks, private banks.
They are going to offer this financial advisor services are financial advisor agencies.
Okay, so you can go and you can contact.
So like this what our personal questions are regarding personal finance.
Okay, we are going for advisory services.
You can get all your answers for whatever inquiries you have.
You will get all sort of and tell us additions you are going to get with the Chargeability.
Let us discuss about pension or pension scheme after the retirement.
What is the future about how we need to maintain for our medical bills or financial what our commitments will be correct.
So for day to day expenses we requirement.
So we'll see.
We'll ask few questions on the retirement and pensions.
My face squarely is what are the key factors to consider when planning for retirement?
If, for example, after ten years or 15 years I am going to retire, are I'm planning to retire?
Correct.
So how we need to or what are the factors we need to consider when we go for it or when we are planning for a retirement?
So the body will use few suggestions or advisors.
What are the key factors?
We need to keep it in our mind and then we need to plan for our retirement after 15 years or 20 years.
Correct.
So first one is retirement goals.
So we need to set a clear retirement goal.
If, for example, if I'm going to retire after 15 years means I need to, we have this much of cash in hand and this much of balance we need to save in the bank or this match of amount.
I need to invest on this particular securities, or it may be on a real assets that is on land and building.
Okay.
What are the other things there?
How much I need to invest on that so that after retirement I have the money in hand or cash in hand for our day to day expenses.
Me day to day operations, activities of our life.
So it's important to have a clear idea of what you want your retirement to look like.
So this may include like where you want to live, what kind of activities you want to do, and how much money you will need to support your lifestyle.
So I've already told you the day to day activities are there to the expenses.
Okay, we need to plan, for example, for one month how much money is required okay to get that one, whatever the forecasted value?
Is that okay that we need to plan?
And from this to retirement, we need to save that money.
So every month I need to get ₹5,000 just for our household expenses, for medical expenses.
This much for transportation this might total.
This is the amount required after retirement for every month so far.
That money I need to get the after retirement means I need to plan from today.
Okay.
Daniel, you can easily lead your life after retirement.
So next, advisories, retirement age.
So we need to knowing when you plan to retire.
It is important because after ten years, 15 years, what did you need to know at what age you are going to after how many years you are going to retire so that you can plan well in advance next retirement income.
I've already you right.
So which are all the available avenues are there are pension schemes are there are retirement schemes for there or what are the securities assets everything we need to have, the different portfolios are available.
We need to invest and every month I need to get ₹12,000 permanent as an income for living my life.
So that is the retirement income and we need to think about our expenses also.
I already told you about household expenses and medical expenses.
Okay, so whatever the diseases are, whatever the problems are, that for that we required medical, correct?
So doctor assistance is required, medical practitioners are required so that we need to clearly we need to create some resource for that also.
So that we need to think what are the other expenses?
It may arise under particular age.
Okay.
That also we need to forecast now only so savings.
So what is the if for example, if I'm going to invest, what are the expenses that amount.
Okay, I'm going to get whatever the returns for my savings that we to think investment strategy, different avenues are available, especially for retirement.
Okay.
We have retirement planning only there.
Okay.
Our retirement funds will be there.
So how much do we need to invest in that particular things?
What I take for the money for my particular lifestyle.
Okay, so that we need to think debt management.
So if you have do that or if you are alone.
Okay, so before your retirement only you need to plan for completing that loads or whatever the dates are there.
If for example, I am going to return within ten years, then you need to make sure that you need to complete your debt within that period only.
So after retirement, if you are planning to complete that loans, it will affect you.
What Retirement estate planning.
You should also have a plan for what will happen to your assets after you pass.
This may include creating your will or trust and naming beneficiary forever retirement account.
So after you were explaining, we need to think about for whom will be we need to allocate all these assets or whatever the bank accounts are the like nominee.
We need to nominate.
Correct.
So inflation rate depending on the inflation rate.
Also, we need to plan and health care.
So these are the few advisories given by the activity and also if there are more questions on this retirement goals or retirement age.
Okay.
Or retirement income or debt management, inflation, health care.
Okay.
You can ask your particular question or query on this particular information.
So that is going to give the more information related to that.
Next question, what type of retirement accounts or pension plans are available to me.
So, for example, I am going to plan to retire after ten years or after 15 years.
Okay.
From today so what are the all accounts?
Are pension accounts or retirement accounts are available for me so that easily I can retire after 15 years and I can easily live my life.
Okay.
So these are the few advisories given by the chargeability that is for not planned individual retirement account.
That is IRS simplified employee pension ACP defined Benefit plans, Thrift Savings Plan that is DSP 457 Plan Annuities.
So these are the fuel plans or pension plans available are account retirement accounts are available for an individual so in this also for example, if you are not knowing about 401.
Plans, you can check on this particular for not one plant for example what is for not one.
Plans of.
Retirement.
So Judge Liberty will give you all the information regarding this format.
One plant format one is a plan that is a type of employer sponsored retirement plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their pretax income to retirement account.
See that will use the age limit what is the amount are with whatever the age limit are there tell that employer is going to use this advantage.
Everything that will gives you about this for not one plan like that.
If you have any queries regarding all these points.
Also you can dig into deeper with the chargeability.
It will advise a retail duty.
What is that clear information regarding that particular qualities there that will gives you the clear information so question How can I plan for retirement if I have a limited income or financial resources?
If, for example, per month I'm going to earn a 10,000 a piece of salary.
So with that ₹10,000 of salary, how can I plan better for my retirement?
So planning for retirement can be challenging when have the limited income or financial resources.
So if you are earning more money, then that is not a big challenge for you to keep some money for your plan also.
But if you are getting very less money on that time, it is very difficult for planning for our retirement.
The first we need to do start saving early.
So when you start earning the income from that on time only you can start saving some money for your future, for your retirement.
Take the advantages of your employer retirement plans.
If any retirement plans are offered by your employer, please take advantage of that so that you can have a very good plan of your retirement.
You can easily deliver after retirement, live life within your means.
It's important to live within your means and avoid taking on debt that you can't afford to pay back.
For example, I cannot repay the debt off and lack of peace, so I don't have the capability of repaying that money or that loan.
So on that scenario, please don't go for that large amount of loans, a large amount of debt, whatever is visible from your end to repay that money or repay that debt, go for that.
So Next, consider downsizing.
Look for ways to increase your income.
Take advantage of tax breaks.
Be mindful of your expenses so this are a leave you advisors given by the charity put forward ways For example, we can ask one more question.
So if earning ₹10,000 Vermont.
How can I.
Plan for my retirement?
So if I'm getting very low money or low salary, so on that time also you can have your queries with the charge of beauty.
So will also help you to do very good retirement plan for your future.
So set the retirement goal.
I already told you you need to clearly say that retirement.
How after all many years you are going to retire so open a retirement account.
So consider opening your retirement account so does Provident Fund or a public Provident fund PPF in India and make a regularly contribution.
These are going to offer tax benefits and can help you to build up your retirement savings over the time.
So whatever the amount you are going to invest in PPF account for that you can get the tax advantage.
Also the end.
You are going to get very good lump sum return also, so contribute to employer sponsored plan.
So if any plans offered by your employer for your retirement or for your future, please invest in that.
Start small and increase contribution over time.
So start saving small, small amount, then you can start investing.
Okay, Be mindful of your expenses.
So what are the expenses?
Are there?
Take get out please.
Or other control over that expenses.
Next consult their financial advisor.
So like this few advisory services are advisors given by the charge differ if you are earning than those in rupees are now going to plan better for my future.
Oh, the tangibility is going to be useful for the banking sector.
Okay, so we'll see one by one.
I will ask some on banking sector and how the deputy is going to suggest so.
First question on banking sector, what are the different types of banking services available to customer?
So usually we need to check with the banker.
For example, if I am the savings bank, a controller of SBA or Kendra Bank or Axis Bank.
So first what we are going to check, So what are the services that are going to provide for their customers?
Correct.
So First, we are going to check.
So that same question I have asked for this Chargeability.
So here are a few suggestions, are few answers for our questions.
So first one is savings account.
As a banker, first and foremost, services that are going to offer for the customer is savings bank account.
The main objective?
Our primary objective of this savings bank accounts are create a savings habit with the public.
So what we are going to do if our excess of money in our own so what we are going to do, we are going to deposit in our bank account.
So that is the one habit this savings bank account will create for all individuals.
Correct.
So that is the first service.
All the banking sectors are that will offer second one checking account.
A checking account is a type of bank account that is designed for everyday transactions as paying bills and making purchases.
So what are the different types of accounts that bankers are going to offer?
For example, as an new I can open our savings bank account.
Are they going to open in a recurring deposit account or at the end account, open fixed deposit account?
Correct.
If I'm the owner of a company or I'm going to rent one company.
So on that time, Vanguard is going to offer a current account.
So for current account also they are going to give fuel services, additional services they are going to offer.
That is a number of times withdrawals are a number of time deposits.
All those things will be that and overdue facility.
That is the added advantage for this current account.
Like that, they're going to check the accounts as forever.
What are the transaction?
Turnovers are there.
According to that.
They are going to check what is that type of account.
They can offer a next debit cards nowadays, Digital India or digital transaction, we are going to do correct.
So for debit cards also it will be useful instead of carrying the cash so we can carry debit cards like in fuel center or for any shopping malls and other things.
We can carry simple debit cards.
Then we can easily we can complete our shopping's next credit cards.
So credit cards, usually we are going to use collect.
So what are the bank account are there they are going to offer.
So, for example, if you have your bank account in SBI, you can get a credit card from SB and in some scenarios, if you don't, are the account.
Also, for example, I don't have a content SBI, but also SBI will offer the credit card.
And with that credit card, I can go and without any balance in my account, but also I can purchase what are the goods or services or products are required and I need to repay that money, whatever the due dates are that are maturity, period.
Is that within that I need to repay for the banker that is the one more services offering by the banker.
I will ask one question for chargeability What are the different kinds of loans available?
See If I go to Banker?
Also, I'm going to ask what are the different types of loans they are going to offer and what is the interest rate?
So if you are going to bank and if you are going to us instead of that, if you ask the chargeability, what are the different kinds of loans offered by the banker and what is the interest rate at what period for the limit for ten years, they are going to give personal loan at 15 years they are going to give some other loan are vehicles loans.
Usually vehicle loans are offered for seven years.
Correct.
So all these things physically, no need to go to any banker.
Instead of that, you can ask Chargeability.
So my question, what are the different loans offered by bankers?
So first one, personal loan, auto loans, mortgage loan that is, have secured loans, student loans, loans, payday loans, lines of credit.
So these are the fuel loans the banker is going to offer for their customer.
Okay.
These are the common questions also you can ask.
And whatever the suggestions are there, the deputy is going to useful to give the suggestion for your queries and comes back to the earlier question.
So next investment services.
So you are a banker.
They're going to offer investment services also, for example, I don't have any knowledge about investing money in the stock market, so that time banker will correct that services they are going to offer online and mobile banking facility services, wire transfer, foreign exchange services.
So these are the few services offered by the banker.
So have you got to know the type Jeopardy is going to give the all the services offered by the banker if you have any, regarding this?
Also, you can ask, so on this foreign exchange services, so I can ask what are the doubts I out.
So I need to exchange my currency have U.S.
dollars so I need to convert in to Indian rupee.
So I need to know how much they are going to charge for the transaction or for their services.
So my question is transaction cost.
The banker will charge for the foreign exchange.
So here are a few suggestions.
The transaction cost also depending on the banker to banker.
Okay, it's going to vary.
So exchange rate commission.
So what is the exchange rate for that particular rate that they are going to charge and commission?
The banker is going to charge and transfer fees from U.S.
dollar to whatever the Indian rupee they are going to transfer to your bank account for that.
They are going to charge and and link charges, other charges.
So these are a few cost involved for the exchange of one currency to the other currency.
So If you want to get to know all this, what are the rates or transaction cost we need to earlier, we need to go for the bank.
Not only are we need to call our personal advisors, so instead of that now, we can easily get all this information with Chad, Djibouti only.
Next question.
Everyone are thinking like as a payment, public order investors, they are going to tell if you invest your money in the bank or if you are going to deposit your money in the bank, that will be safer.
So if we are going to deposit our money in our bank account, Correct.
So what are the safety measures we have?
Are what are the bank they are going to take a few steps to ensure our safety offered.
So that question I will ask Chargeability now.
So how do banks, the safety and security of the customers funds as an individual?
I'm also a customer for a banker.
Correct.
So how much safety is there for funds?
Are my deposits.
So banks have a variety of measures in place to ensure the safety of security of customers funds, so they will make sure they help.
What are these steps for keeping the money safe for of all the customers?
So first one is FDIC insurance.
So they are going to take the FDIC insurance.
FDIC is nothing but Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
So they are going to take the insurance with this.
Okay.
So insured deposits in most of the banks up to a certain amount that is currently to like 50,000 per depositor per insured bank.
So this insurance, they are going to take this again, one physical security.
So banks have the physical security measures in place.
Online security will be there.
Anti-Fraud measures, a risk management or compliance with regulations.
So these are the measures the banker is going to take for their customers deposited money or whatever the funds invested by the customers in their account that these are the measures they are going to take.
So like this are the queries we are asked and the chargeability is going to suggest.
So these are the measures the banker will take for their deposits next.
Question How the banker used technology to improve the services of their whatever their day to day operations are, that there are additions are few answers from the Chargeability.
So using this, what are the advanced technologies?
Are they okay?
The banker, how they are going improve the customer service base.
So first one, online banking services.
Nowadays everyone are using this online banking transaction, correct?
So earlier, if we want to transform our money, so we need to go to banker physically and we need to fill the form and then we need to give it to the cashier and then we are going to transfer the money correct.
So but now if we want to transfer money from one account to other account or one person to other person, usually, okay, we are going to go for online banking.
We are going to transfer order, we are going to use this mobile banking, all bankers that are having the apps, mobile apps.
Correct.
So we are going to log into the banking and we are going to transfer data and now we can easily deposit our money also in the depositor machines.
Correct.
So It also works as a deposit mission nowadays and electronic payment and customer relationship risk management, data analytics, blockchain technology.
Okay, so these are the few technology they can use.
And again, and that is the customer service base.
Okay, So these are the solutions given by the CHARGEABILITY for the whatever the technology using banker to improve their customer service business.
So like this, what are the questions you have regarding the banking sector?
If you ask the question that really gives answer indeed tax format.
So these are a few suggestions are few.
Whatever the answer is given by the CHARGEABILITY for the banking sector, let us discuss on investment strategies and portfolio wealth management.
Okay, so how Djibouti is going to helpful for getting the information on this investment strategies.
So first question for the investment strategies are what are they some effective investment strategies for long term wealth building?
So if we want to invest, so what we are going to think first we are going to think safety of our funds, whether whatever our investments are there, whether safety is there or not.
Next one, the liquidity, how easily we can convert into cash, whatever instruments we have that we need to convert into cash.
That is the second one and third one we are going to looking at the return on the investment.
Correct.
So these are three things we are going to check.
So if we invest for the long term, how much wealth we can build on that particular instrument.
So let's see, what are the additions or strategies the tangibility is going to provide for this question.
So here the few solutions given by detached is pretty far increase the long term world or wealth building in the investment strategies.
So first one, diversification.
So diversification is nothing.
But for example, if I owe ₹10,000 for investment or savings, I have four investments, correct?
So on that time I need to do, I'm going to invest all ₹10,000 in the equity.
That is the diversification.
No, but if I'm going to invest all ten those in the debentures or it may be preferential, that is not the diversification.
Correct.
So diversification is nothing.
But we need to divide or we need to invest our money in the different avenues.
For example, in stock only R&D securities only, for example, for those in I'm going to invest in equity share.
For those, a group is investing in the preferential and remaining 2000.
I'm going to invest in debenture.
So this is called diversification.
Why we are to do this diversification means to reduce the risk or minimize the risk involved in that securities.
Correct.
So that is the first suggestion given by the target.
So spreading your investment across different asset classes like stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities can reduce your risk exposure and ensure the balanced portfolio.
So we need to balance the risk and the return.
So if we want a return, then risk is also high.
So if we want a moderate, then your risk will be moderate like that.
We need to balance our risk in return.
So on that scenario, we can get the more wealth for the long term.
Next edition is buy and hold.
So for example, I wanted to give the example for ₹10,000.
I am going to invest 4000 in equity four, thousand in differentiate and four 2000 in debenture.
So if I purchased today after one year, what I am going to do, if I am going to sell that, what are the 10,000 shares or ₹10,000 of securities, what how I'm going to sell it for ₹15,000.
So my profit is ₹5,000.
So if you are going to sell within one year or two years or very short term periods, then you cannot maximize or you cannot build wealth.
So you need to hold for at least for 10 to 15 years.
Okay, so you feel that securities for a long term, then only you can get a good wealth after the whatever the holding periods are that after that you are going to get very good amount or very good return and growth of your securities value also.
So you to hold for the long durations.
So this strategy involves buying stock or funds and holding onto them for the long term.
So long term is at least you need to hold for ten years, then you are going to expect very good return and growth of your investment.
So next dollar cost averaging, so investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals regardless of market condition can help to smooth out the impact of market volatility, for example.
So every month I'm going to say ₹5,000, but here it is, ₹60,000, correct So what I am going to do every year, 60,000.
I'm going to invest in the stock market, whether what may be the market conditions out of that.
But I'm going to invest 60, 60,000 every year.
So again, I'm going to get that very good return.
So the market fluctuation is also there.
Whatever the volatility or fluctuations are there in the market.
But also I'm going to invest, I'm going to get a good return at the end.
That is the third point.
Next forward rebalancing so regularly reviewing your portfolio and rebalancing it to maintain your desired asset allocation can help you to capture gains and minimize losses.
So whatever the amount you have invested so that you need to regularly check how do you need to regularly do the transaction in the Demat account or whatever these securities, whatever the assets you are invested, you need to check if it is something is decreased or increased, then you need to do the rebalancing further.
Securities tax efficient investing.
Nowadays?
Yes.
For what are the tax payments are there or what are the government is going to allow under section eight DC to aid you for the deductions?
Correct.
So we are going to plan or we are going to do the tax planning for the particular financial year.
Correct.
So on that time also you can go for investing your money in the stock market or whatever the tax savings funds are there consistency seek professional advisors.
No, Chargeability is also going to give the like professional advisors.
So.
You can type your questions in jeopardy.
For example, every year I'm ready to invest 60,000 in the stock.
Oh, I can balance the portfolio how much I need to invest in the different avenues if you ask that question.
So ability will give you so different answers or whatever the strategies are there or whatever the advisory services are that that target is going to give that example, I will take note.
So if.
Every year I am ready to invest ₹60,000 in which.
Avenue.
I need to invest.
My money.
So the best avenue for investing your money depends on your investment goal.
So in the previous sessions we have discussed that is personal finance, Correct.
So what is your goal?
First, we need to set a clear goal.
Either it may be a short term goal or long term goal.
If we are clear goals or financial goals, then only we can plan all the other things.
So first one, mutual funds.
You can invest your money, whatever the 60,000 is that you can invest on mutual funds, stocks.
That is nothing, but you are all Securities and Public Provident Fund PPF account.
You can open up of account and you can invest your money National Pension scheme.
And because that is also one avenue you can invest are real estate.
Okay, so these are the suggestions given by the Chargeability.
If you had any queries like advisory services will provided by the Chargeability for it.
Qualys.
So next question.
How can I diversify my investment portfolio to minimize the risk?
That is the last question.
We have discussed how we need to invest in different avenues or what are the avenues that are available for investing our money?
Correct.
So next question I'm going to ask for how we are going to diversify our investments.
We can reduce our risk and we can manage the risk in our portfolio.
So there are few suggestions given by the charge that is asset classes.
So what are the different asset classes?
Are there.
Okay.
First we need to check like in different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate or commodities and cash.
Okay, so these are the different avenues that are available.
So first we need to check which are the feasible avenues for us.
Okay, we can invest in that or we can trade in that that we need to check.
Second thing, we can go for like geographical boundaries.
So invest in different regions and countries to take advantage of opportunities and mitigate risk associated with the local economic and political conditions.
So for the or according to whatever the economic conditions are, their political conditions are there.
So depending on that, also, we need to plan our investment next sector otherwise, which is the for example, banking sector or manufacturing sector, REIT sector, what are the sectors are in which our is there in the big or whichever is going good or it is making good profit in the economy that we need to check sectorial ways and then we need to start investing our money sector wise investment vehicles.
So use different investment vehicles such as mutual funds, exchange state funds, individual stocks, bonds, etc.
So we need to think literally riders or vehicles are there in the market.
According to that, we need to start investing our money.
So risk levels.
So what is the risk level are involved in that particular sector?
Are particular securities that we need to check and then we need to invest in.
For example, high risk is there for that particular sector, for example.
So on that time, whether we need to invest in that sector or not, that we need to take after COVID affect medical companies or whatever the medicine companies are, that they're making very good profit, correct.
So under time that is the in boom.
So on that time we need to invest on particular stock market or whatever these sector are there and that we need to invest whichever is having the high risk under time.
We need to think and then we need to invest our money in that particular securities.
They are reasons.
So what are the time period you are going to invest, whether it may be a short term, medium term, long term that you need to check and then you need to invest your money.
So is the important things for any individual to minimize their risk and diversify their assets or diversify their portfolio management and to their money?
So these are the few suggestions.
So next question How should I balance the risk and return when investing in different types of assets?
I already told you we need to diversify our funds.
We need to invest in different avenues or different asset classes are there in that we need to invest, Correct.
So in that also risk is involved.
So how should I balance that risk if I am going to invest in different assets or different types of avenues?
Here are the few suggestions will see.
So balancing risk and return is a key consideration when investing in these different types of asset.
So wherever it may be, not only for us, there are not only for security or any other things.
Okay, we need to check what is the risk in return.
After that, only we need to invest our money.
So first one, I understand you risk tolerance.
So how much you are capable to maintain or how much capable you are to take the risk.
First you need to check.
Okay.
So second one, determine your investment goals.
So in the personal finance only, we have discussed, First, we need to set our financial goal, whether it may be a short term, long term, medium term.
First, we need to set a clear goal.
Next, allocate your assets so which are the assets are available and how much money I'm going to unlock for each assets that we need to clearly set.
And next, diversify your portfolio, rebalance your portfolio and review and are just so these are the few suggestions, a few advisors given by the chart.
Yep.
Due to balancing the risk and return bucket while investing in the different types of assets.
So other than this, if you have any queries regarding particular investment or particular assets that also questions you can ask for chargeability under travel advice as it takes format, it's going to give the advisory forever queries.
Here are the few queries.
An advisory given by the Chargeability.
Let us discuss about credit score our credit management so everyone knows about credit scores.
Correct.
So as an individual we will call this CIBIL rating, correct.
So CIBIL rating is nothing but the individual.
For example, X is a person how much is capable to repay their debt.
So that cibil rate will give you the information of that zero person.
How much is capable to repay their debt back?
Okay, so will see in charge of will ask a few on this credit score and grade management.
Everyone will think how this CIBIL rating is calculated.
For example, day to day ways everyone will get phone calls from the credit card.
Correct.
Are some loans set up for you?
Whatever the credit scores are that are supported, we a d pre approved credit card are pre-approved loans is available for free.
What account how they're going to get to know what is my credit score how they're going calculate the credit score of an individual.
So.
How this equated correct so time what I'm going to do I'm going to ask D so admissions or advisor offer Chargeability so that whatever this admissions they can give on this particular query.
So what is a credit score and how is this calculated?
Auto Is it calculated individually?
I already told you the credit score is a numerical representation of a person.
So for example, X, y, z person is that it's going to numerically represent okay with this criteria numbers are that so they are going to get one.
Okay.
So according to that, how much you are capable are all your financial institution or banks?
Everyone, they are going to check this credit score and then they are going to give the loans are they are going to provide loans.
So credit worthiness, that is the credit repayment capacity of an individual.
So it is calculated on you are the information contained in their credit report, which includes their credit history.
So past whatever the EMI are credit repayments.
I'm going to do are that y that person is going to do what is done correct so that they are going to take the past transaction are past history of that particular person and then they are going to calculate this credit score.
So payment history or the outstanding debt.
So the most commonly used credit score in the United States is the FICO score, which ranges from 300 to 850, the higher the score, the better the individual credit worthiness perceived to be.
So if our credit rating score is more like 750 800, then you're very good.
That is your credit repayment capacity is very good.
So That is how they are going to calculate.
And these are the criterias.
Okay.
So there are several factors that are taken into consideration when calculating the credit score.
So in brief, we are told you like, so what is the credit history of that particular person payment history or the outstanding debt based on that they are going to calculate?
So your discharge, if it is given clear information, what are the things that are going to take into consideration while calculating the credit score of a particular person?
So payment history, whether it may be about credit card bills every month or on time, you are going to pay the credit bill or whatever the elements are that are whatever the debts you are taken for, that you need to repay the EMV.
Correct?
So one device you need to pay that is regularly, you are going to pay are not in sometime if you are delayed or any transaction was denied from, you are doing everything that will do so amount owed.
That is how much amount they are going to take.
That is d these are for 30% of the score and looks at the total amount owed across all the credit accounts.
For example, my income is 50,000 already taken and affluent.
Okay.
After also if I am going to planning to take out, if I'm planning to take then the banker they are going to check what is their total owes you have.
Okay.
Based on that.
Also they are going to calculate and they're going to disburse or they are going to approve some amount of loan length of credit history.
So these are conferred 15 years of this score and looks at how long an individual, as are credit accounts and average age of their accounts.
So, for example, if I'm going to it, oh, so I need to go for it.
Home loan around England.
So how many years you are going to take that loan and what is what age based on that?
Also, they are going to calculate?
And credit makes this account for 10% of the score and looks at the different types of credit accounts and individual us.
So just credit cards, loans and market.
So I already told you not only what loans are, not only were credit cards, they're going to take all the distinct credit card payment or loan payments or whatever, these secured loan that is mortgage loan, you are taking everything they are going to check for their credit score, new credit.
These are going for 10% of this score and looks at how often an individual applies for new credit and the number of recently opened accounts.
So how many times you are going to take the loans, for example?
I'm going to take a loan, personal loan every year because of some commitments, and I am going to repay so that things also makes year or they are going to take into consideration, well, calculating the credit score.
So these are all the meaning of sorry, this is the meaning of credit score and these are a few consideration.
They are going to do well, calculating the credit score.
So these are the advices or suggestions given by the Chargeability for the personal credit scores.
Next question.
If, for example, my credit score is 600, I need to improve my credit score now because I need to purchase a home or apartment.
So I need to go for a loan.
Correct.
So under do I need to improve my credit score?
Otherwise no banker or no financial institution are ready to pay or ready to give the loan to me.
So on that time we need to know what are the strategies are there to improve my credit score so under time that you can ask the judge Deputy So will give you suggestions or advisors to improve our credit score.
So the first suggestion or first advice is pay your bills on time.
So for example, if the credit card bill is due on every month and so you need to pay it on or before ten instead of being, you get paid on the eight nine.
Okay, whenever it is possible or whenever you have the sufficient funds with you, please pay that money.
There is a first advice.
Second one.
There it is.
Your credit card balances.
So Banker Yes, they are going to offer.
Okay.
Based on our past history, past payments that were to offer to increase our money, for example, first year they are going to give for 15,000 as element next year.
What are the past payment?
They are ready to increase your credit card limit for 30,000 or 45,000.
So instead of simply increasing based on your requirement, you can go further.
Otherwise, please reduce the credit card balance.
Next, pay down the debt.
So what other debts are there are loans are that try to reduce the debts or try to repay the debt.
High levels of debt.
Okay So especially on credit cards, can negatively impact our credit score.
So so as much as possible, reduce the credit card bills on that time.
Next, check your credit report for energy.
So in that credit report only they are going to give.
What are the errors?
You are done.
So is the reason they have deducted this many points are they have given the what are the credit score for you?
Okay, check that.
Whatever you have done in the next keep all accounts open.
The length of your credit history is a factor in determining your credit score.
People are always going to open to demonstrate a long credit history.
So what are the world accounts are there that needs to be like open because they are going to regularly that money.
Correct.
So that should be one strategy.
Don't open too many new accounts at once.
Okay?
Don't go for whatever the new loans are available or whatever the requirements are there.
Okay.
Don't open many accounts or many loans.
Account.
Next, consider a secured credit card.
Okay, So these are the few suggestions for improving your credit score given by the charge equity.
So if you follow these strategies, then you can easily go out or you can get a good credit score.
We have one quote Prevention is better cure.
We looked at what are the strategies available for improving our credit score before that?
What are the common mistakes are?
How are going to do the mistakes while negatively impacting our credit score that we can avoid?
Correct.
So we'll see.
What are the common mistakes everyone are going to do for their credit score negatively impacting on the credit score.
So first one, late or missed payment.
So have given the example of an easy were credit card bill is due correct we need to pay victim that don't miss the repaying that whatever the outstanding is that you need to pay on or before the due date.
Next maximizing our credit cards.
So increasing the limit, closing old credit accounts, applying for too much of credit at once already you about this correct.
So defaulting on loans, ignoring your credit report, cosigning for someone else.
So we are going to do this accurately.
Correct.
That is also negatively impact of your credit score because if they are not paid, then it will comes to you people only.
So these are live you advisors they're given for this particular Kuwaiti.
So like this in Djibouti, whatever inquiries you have regarding, this credit score are CIBIL rating.
And what are the common mistakes or improving credit score?
Everything you can ask the chart, Deputy and it will use advisors in the text format.

If you want to know more about Chad, Djibouti are slow to do a deal on Chad.
Djibouti is available on our channel.
You can go and check it out.
First, let's break down Djibouti Generator's Pre-Trained transformer.
In simple terms, imagine beating a friend to write stories.
You would first give them dozens of books to read, right?
That's Exactly what we do with Djibouti.
We feed it a huge amount of text from books, articles and websites.
This called the training.
During training, Djibouti learns the basics of language that is grammar sentence structure, and even some facts about the world.
It's like the air is soaking up all this knowledge.
Djibouti is built using a special architecture called a Transformer.
It's specifically the decoder part of the transformer.
This structure is really good at understanding the context of the books, for example.
It knows the distance between Apple, the fruit and Apple, the company based on the surrounding books.
The transformer decode, though, has layers.
Imagine a sandwich.
Each layer processes information and passes it to the next meal.
Getting more refined with each step.
This has Djibouti understand and generate human like text.
Now then you give DVD a prompt like Once Upon a Time.
It uses everything it can learn to predict and generate the next part of the story.
One word a time.
It's like a super smart autocomplete.
You can use Djibouti for a lot of school things writing essays, coding, creating content, and even chatting with virtual assistants.
I hope you are excited to start experimenting with the exciting existing activities in Tag Unity and even create your own customized DVD on the platform.
Imagine a tool designed specifically to provide you with personalized and professional insights.

Now this is your input.
And then you write here and you prompt it, you give you the response.
And here you can see the versions variable, whatever versions you can use.
GPT 3.5 stupid default you pitiful.
However, we are here to see how in jeopardy we can create our own custom goodies.
First, let's explore various different goodies.
Now there is a explored goodies option.
You click on that and you will see this on your screen.
Now here is, a search bar there.
You can search different goodies, whatever you want do.
So it's for example, you want to search something one data things.
You write data science and it will give you different options.
What do you want to do?
These are different business.
Nice ideas that you're already custom built for you to use.
So if you click on data science and create a data science jeopardy, it do give you an expert for data analysis and visualization.
You can provide a dataset whatever custom dataset you want to provide and ask relevant portions for data analysis and visualization, excluding data analysis, outlier detection, etc., etc.
However, before jumping on to that, let's see what are the different types of GP these GP offers?
Now if you see here, these are the topics what it has told you Mummy child that is an official jeopardy for mommy team generating mommy diagrams or chuck for text that is size speech.
There is landing page create for from HubSpot there is excu exploit the tweet give you optimization and weightings for your database.
Now there are different fields in which algebra gives you custom goodies that is writing productivity writing.
There you will have write for me which is tailored for for creating engaging content did focus on quality relevance and besides what you can give that okay in this number of votes, give me a simplified version on some topic or some concept that you want to understand and write this for me in a blog format or in an article format or in a book format.
Right?
Humanized.
I generated X2, video makeup and innovative video makeup board that creates and edits dynamic reveals that what you saw was using the app I would do okay.
Then there are copyright to Djibouti.
There is for marketing and branding and ads.
Right then you can have you can go to productivity.
Productivity has canva diagrams for, your presentations which can create diagrams for your presentations.
There are slides stupid for creating your PowerPoint presentations.
You give the content.
I can you presentations which you can export in PowerPoint format, Google slide format, WTO format, whatever format you want.
Then there is image generator below the powerful image generation doing for you or Djibouti for you.
Then there is video.
Djibouti, by the way, there, Canva.
Then next is research and analysis.
In research analysis you have scholar, Djibouti scholar.
I then say space, Excel, Djibouti.
These things you can explore and you can see how they have been performing, because if they have been performing, either they would be on topics of branding section.
Then you have education.
In education, you have mathematics, all what you would build.
Then you have diagram creating is universal primer the fastest way to learn like you do, You write so everything and it gives you from there it has to make, for example is like Khan Academy.
Okay And previously we thought video jeopardy by the day.
So it gives you by who this has been created by whom like for example diagram diagram has been quite helpful.
Not the canvas by can go so it features job jubilee features Jeopardy some various different actions that different organizations who wants to offer an integration which Djibouti Then you have lifestyle, you have astrology lifestyle, travel guide gaming, then you have in programing, you have good copilot, which helps you with programing.
You can learn python with Python Jubilee, you can have vet say generator.
This is a Djibouti for creating that site for you.
Then there is a good Djibouti, which you with Python Java Sea at sea in the sequel JavaScript.
Really all these programing languages then you have will export and many more.
So these are the custom GP, these which are all ready bed in your Djibouti platform and you can use them based on whatever modern Djibouti model that you are using.
But let's know first, diving before diving into creating your own custom Djibouti.
Let's quickly check one custom Djibouti from Djibouti.
Okay, So let's do data science, which specializes in which is by Oracle and is an exploratory specializes in data analysis and visualization so we create a data science Djibouti.
And it gives you the reading also from this category.
It has been taken data how many conversations and what is the reading for this and what are the conversations that those conversations that needs it give you suggestions when you talk or when you want your Djibouti to give you suggestions?
Okay.
How you can start your conversation or how you can continue and it gives you the capabilities it has, browsing capabilities it has daily.
LLN which for images and got interpreter and data analysis tool, which is an integration with Djibouti and the readings right.
So let's stop now.
It has created a similar chat.
Okay, but your jeopardy is data science, so let's start analyzing some data.
We have big titanic dataset from Google for this activity.
So I load my Titanic data.
Set here.
And write a prompt, check the data for missing values and give Biden good for the sea.
Because when you first load a data, you first of all see added any missing values.
You do data people syncing and then data preprocessing.
The first step is seeing if your data has missing values or not.
So we enter this.
So what does it do?
It gives you, okay, these are your columns in your data set on the chart.
Passenger I.D.
class name, the gender, the age, etc.
and it gives you data.
It contains missing values for falling columns.
How many columns click stage, cabin and inbox, How many values?
Each has 177 missing values.
Gavin has 687 missing values in boxes dual missing values.
How to do the coding for this?
If you want to implement on your local for the same, you can copy the same good that it imports.
PANDAS Library gives the file box.
You can give the file book, the CAC, you can read CSP, this python function.
Then in missing values it'll do is snaffled got some function will you all the missing values?
No.
This is your code for missing values for titanic data set before on to on next.
It gives you already gives you a prompt.
Can you visualize the missing data?
Or you can go to how to handle these missing values.
So click on it.
How to handle these missing values.
So it could give you you can drop your missing values, you can impute missing values.
You can use predictive imputation.
Right.
And it is giving you all the goods that, okay, if you want to drop, if you want to impute, if you want to do predictive imputation.
So all of these things are given and prompted by Jeopardy.
However, if you see your chat, it is more towards generic.
But this Djibouti customs, you believe that this data signs Djibouti is customized for you, for your specific data or for your specific.
That's that's right.
It asks specific things or you can gives specific prompts related to your data.
Now show the updated dataset in the table tableau format or visualize its distribution.
What are they you want to do?
Or you can give your own thing that pre-processing the data, but we have already pre process data that we have imputed the missing values.
You can do visualization.
Let's click on visualization.
It will give you a distribution you know, analyzing and gives you an easy distribution because based on the data, it would have seen that each as a factor for data.
Any dataset holds much more value than other features in your dataset.
Now survival right now Visualize we can do any visualization, but these analyzes survival rates by passenger class.
You can go on because it did you based on your data.
Supposing I just want to switch to got to the end that okay I want to make a predictive model that answers the question what sorts of people will more likely to survive using passenger data?
Get I give this an expense on the scene that okay, do pre-processing do feature selection, do models training, do evaluation and then it gets it.
Okay.
Tightening day does it.
These are the steps However here it must that you have already on that okay You have done the missing values you have brought you have imbued.
If you did and you want to continue, you have visualized you want to continue that one exist last and you can give that feedback to your custom jeopardy that okay, these are the things that got missed and these what I want do continue with the conversation.
Now those I was having the context should be the same.
However, thankfully, that the Djibouti picked up the same that okay previous is your data in that handle missing values convert categorical values into numeric, standardize or normalize data.
Then that is feature selection model, training, model evaluation.
And it is giving you the input because the first run we said these give the Python book.
If you do not give the problem that you want some type of good out of it, any language it will not give you.
Okay.
So this is taking context from the first one that we give.
Now you have all the codes and you can execute if this just performing for you and it has given the explanation is that that you have missing values for these these were the categorical values that were converted to numerical now selected features were these model training splitting was done, annual logistic regression as a model was applied.
And you the accuracy I don't see and you see what I do see go to spoil blocking to visualize the performance.
Okay so all these things are given as good.
However, you are not seeing the result.
You can ask that.
For example, on what basis did the feature selection happen or what was the stick ratio?
However, you can see the split issue.
You can ask why this that ratio why it was divided in two 8020 ratio, why not 7038?
And you can have these interactions and see that, okay, logistic regression may not work for this dataset.
Can we try some other model?
It can be random forest, it can be nice bias, right?
So test out.
This is one of the custom Djibouti that Jan Djibouti provides for you.
Okay, now let's go and check how to create your own Djibouti.
I clicked on Explore Djibouti.
And if you see your a box from your djibouti's here.
The custom is that Djibouti provides you have a clear option, right?
You And click on create.
And next thing you know, you have to screen that you are creating a configuring your new Djibouti there.
You give the name, you give the features, all these things that you want to get in create option.
You can interact with ChatGPT.
There, it asks you a series of questions like How may I help you when this asking you that you want to make creative?
You know, I something like make a creative who helps generate visuals for new products or you want to make a software who helps you format your code?
What do you want to do?
You can do this as an interactive format, or if you have a direction in your mind, you can just put all the details.
What is the name of the new video you want to create?
What is the description?
What are the instructions it should follow?
What are the conversations that you saw?
Right.
It is optional.
You want to give you keep the knowledge you you can upload.
What are the capabilities you want to include in that.
Right.
So all of these things, if you have a direct direction, you can directly fill it.
But if you do not have correct direction, you have just overall an idea of what to do.
When you know, how do you know what to create, then you can have a conversation and be on from your conversation.
The job Djibouti.
This feature was Djibouti.
It updates you've configured.
But so here we would be creating a sports role analytics Djibouti, which analyzes the to analyze all things for your favorite sport, be it cricket V in football, whatever data you provide.
No, I want to create these drone cricket.
So I have a description that sports Blue Analytics interprets player performance data, generates statistical analysis and offers insight theme strategies.
It predicts game outcomes, evaluates play player sickness and optimizes training regimes.
Additionally, it provides detailed breakdowns of game plays and performance metrics.
So what and what sport you are fond of, it can break down everything for you from player performance to prediction of your next game.
It is an exciting to see.
So I have created the description the instructions for this already.
So the my instructions have what does this Djibouti do?
How does it behave?
What should it a widely I have all these things already listed it down so I just copy paste and give it.
Okay that what does it do player analysis I you know I'm telling the strategy insights.
Whatever I have given, I've given in bullet point is okay for this player performance.
What needs to be done for team strategy insights what needs to be done, what does not need to be done.
All these things I have given that, okay, now they do.
Your analytics should have a bit of an approach.
So all these do's and don'ts I have given as an instruction already now as my knowledge, I do not want to do a conversation starter.
You can keep any conversations out there.
You can put as analyze your player performance example, you can keep analyze player performance.
You you can do anything.
Check who will sign what example anything.
But I want I have a data like no on cricket.
I want this jeopardy my custom jeopardy to be playing on that data.
Okay, I'll upload all my data cricket match data player data beam data find data will get based on fine based on being performance vs on player performance.
What was the performance, what was the match and upload that.
Let me show you this data edge then.
For example, your cricket beam data has random make India, Australia, England and New learning how many matches it has.
That team has played, how many wins, how many loses, how many draws, what were the score?
What were the runs, what were the wickets?
What does the economy did?
What is the run rate?
So like this, we have four different data sets with random small datasets that I'm bringing it on.
So let's go down and see the capabilities.
Ideally, deliver good integrated and data analysis is not done.
You can pick on good indicator and analysis.
Then we have create new action.
Then you click on this.
This is for if you want to have your Djibouti custom deeply involved with a database or schema or a website to be integrated with that, you can add the authentication, you can add the schema, you can import the you order however you want to do.
For this, we are not doing this action for additional it, ask you to use conversation data in order to improve up models that you on.
Right, because it will improve your Djibouti.
Now if you want to test it out, you can message and test it out.
If you want to directly create read, however, I would suggest you to test it out.
List on your preview because you have a review here you can see as you write all these details, you will see this review getting updated.
So let me ask it the prompt that analyze the performance of the dark pool in the last five matches.
And if you analyze if you first go analyze the data that you have, we have provided the knowledge and then it gives the analysis that, okay, Virat Kohli has played these many matches, he has scored these many runs.
This is the batting average.
This is a strike rate.
These are the catches.
Okay?
Now it asks, would you like a detailed analysis or visual representation of any specific aspect of this data you give?
You compare this career averages?
Sure.
Based on your data, you can analyze and go on with that.
Let's do some other branches that.
So as gives strategy is the ask.
What has been India's key to success in last five matches?
What example so it gives you what has been the run rate what has been matches played the get stick and economy rate and it gives you the total look in the similar way you analyze, ask for strategies and looking.
Australia What has been the key strategy for Australia?
If you analyze the data for you because you are providing numerical data, they do give you analysis.
So that's why it's called sports through analytics and by using by clicking the create button, you would create this Djibouti and you can going forward, you can edit it if you have data, you can put more data on it.
And as a knowledge base, you can put more data, you can play around it and it can give you who will win, who is going to win in upcoming matches based on what data you have provided.
This is all for your demo on how you can create your own Djibouti custom.
Djibouti.
I hope this was only a sports flow analytics or analytics based on analytics.
However, can be more creative with your custom goods based on your requirements.
You can do branding, you can do campaigns.
Djibouti.
You can explore how much and however you want.
But the knowledge that you provide, the description that you provide, the instructor said what the Djibouti should do, what it should not do, all these things, how you configure your jeopardy.
These are very important role, how your Djibouti performs for your specialized desk.
